Humanity and Technological Advancement: Five Observations (Or: The “Kacey” Theory)
My dear friends have asked me to put the following ideas down on paper. They believe, erroneously so, that the existence of a physical document will stop me from repeating myself at every meeting, conference and social event I find myself in. Of course, I plan on making the same arguments to every single friendly person I meet until I am either proven wrong or the heat death of the universe occurs. (I am, as of this writing, almost 170 years of age. I am quite certain neither will never happen in my lifetime.) That said, having a backup that exists somewhere outside of my own headspace is indeed a solid idea. For the sake of brevity, I will attempt to keep my Special One’s musings succinct and commentary-free.
1. Humanity is, technologically speaking, on a set path. Nothing short of an extinction level event will derail us from that path.
2. Said path are lined with various technological benchmarks we are instinctively programmed to hit. Examples include, but are certainly not limited to, machine-based printing, vehicles powered by something other than animal labor and relatively instantaneous global communication.
3. Each benchmark can assume multiple forms and be attempted multiple times before taking hold.
4. Society readily adapts its belief systems and moral codes to fit the needs of the benchmark.
5. The human race approaches each and every oncoming benchmark with a sense of optimism and wonder. The fear, foreboding and fatalism that inevitably infects loud pockets of the population is, in the grand scheme of the universe, a momentary distraction that should be ignored.

A Note from the Authors:
We had no idea our tale would unfold in this way.
Our original idea was to give the public at large a chance to see the fabled Three Rivers Swappers Collective in action. A brief, 72-hour foray into our lives, chronicling our highs, lows and every nanosecond in between. In our best-case scenario, the story would exist in the wholly unmapped philosophical expanse where the truth reads like fiction and fiction is treated as fact. Whether or not the moments presented therein actually happened or not would not be of a concern to the reader. Our overarching ideals would shine through whatever fantastical veneer we applied.
We fell flat our collective faces, pun intended.
“I have no idea what the hell is going on,” opined one of our dearest friends after reading our initial draft. “You’d think I’d be able to recognize my own life, but I don’t.” Other reviews were similarly unkind, referring to our manuscript as everything from “confused ramblings” to “Ulysses, but with implants” to “what happens when peanut butter and a tape deck move to Fargo.” While the coherence of the commentary varied from Swapper to Swapper, the general idea remained steady: Go back and try again.
And try we did. Draft after draft, odd idea after odd idea. The fictional conceits, once the centerpiece, were stripped completely. More people, more exploits, more needed explanations. By the time the dust settled, and our typewriters cooled, we wound up with five separate stories – or “acts,” as we like to say. From the beginning:
Act One: The Life and Times of Kacey Pflugh
A long overdue conversation with and about an old friend.
Act Two: Harry and Raven
Of love, loss and Lionel Richie.
Acts Three through Five: October (2127, 2132 and 2138) Our original idea, now in a new, easier to comprehend format.
And so, without further ado, we present the unbridged, uncensored history of the so-called “Immortals on the Corner.” Sit back, relax and enjoy our Westsylvania Tales.
Sincerely,

Chapter One: You’ll Never Walk Alone
Dateline: The Apartment of Tara Pflugh and Kelly Novak, Fombell, PA – Friday,
November 4th, 1977; 7:35 PM
Tangents, By Theodore: ...And with that, our story begins.
Kelly Novak had no plan in place for immortality.
Mere seconds earlier, she thought she could handle anything thrown her way. A breakup would be absolutely, unspeakably terrible, but she knew exactly what to do. Illness? Not a problem. Alien abduction? Rather unlikely, but she did have a few solid ideas at the ready just in case. But not immortality. The mere mention made her head throb.
“Let me go through this insanity one line at a time,” she stated, taking a seat on the picture windowsill near the living room. “Your name is Tara Pflugh, right?”
“As far as you know,” Tara replied with a small, mischievous grin. “I did keep this from you for a ridiculously long time. You never know what other secrets I might be hiding.”
“Let me rephrase then,” Kelly said, her words now filtered between her teeth. “As far as I, and anyone else around here knows, you’re Tara Pflugh.”
A nod.
“You’re my so-called ‘roommate’.”
Another nod.
“But you’re also someone else entirely.”
“That’s a little simplistic,” Tara began, “But technically correct. You’re in the
ballpark, as they say.”
“You’re Doctor Who, aren’t you?” Kelly asked rhetorically. “Everything would
make so much more sense if you were. I bet the next time I see you, you’ll have a stupid British accent and be wearing a stupid looking scarf like stupid Tom Baker!”
Tara took a seat on the floor and crossed her legs. “Sweetie, I’m not connected to Tom Baker in any way. First off, he’s in England and I dislike flying. Secondly, the bloody bastard won’t return my calls. And for the record, his official name is just ‘The Doctor.’ Doctor Who is the show; ‘The Doctor’ is the character.”
Kelly rubbed her eyes in frustration. “Stop. For the love of all that is good and holy, just stop. Now I’m going to ask you again: You’re a woman, right?”
“Of course,” Tara said.
“But you were born a guy.”
“At one point in time, yes,” retorted Tara. “But then again, so were you,
honey.”
“It’s not the same, goddammit!” Kelly yelled. “I just...”
“No explanations needed. I went much too far.” Tara quickly joined her
partner on the window ledge. “Are you sure you want to know? This gets very strange very quickly.”
“I do,” Kelly responded softly.
“Here we go...” Tara looked down. “I don’t know where I stand on the subject of a ‘higher power.’ I never did, really. On one hand, the idea that there’s some dude

up in space watching over us is downright insulting. On the other, I... Let’s just say I don’t find the prospect of ‘you die, then you rot in the ground forever’ particularly inviting. Actually, the concept scares the hell out of me. So, like the good computer person that I am, I made a workaround.”
Kelly steadied her gaze. “You made a workaround for death. That doesn’t sound completely insane or anything.”
“There’s more,” she continued. “Remember that Carnegie-Mellon professor who committed suicide in the computer lab a few years back? Theodore Zordan?”
“Yeah...”
Tara lifted her head. “You’re talking to him, kind of.”
Kelly’s back hit the window. “How?”
“Well...” Tara took a deep breath of her own. “I came up with a way to back
up my mind onto the school’s supercomputer. The experiment worked, but I – ‘I’ being my original male form - died in the process. My girlfriend Tara then put the backup into her head, which merged our personalities together. The person you’re talking to right now is equal parts Theodore Zordan and the original Tara Pflugh.”
“So the backup belonged to a guy,” Kelly said, taking the opportunity to turn the curtains she hated into a decorative handkerchief. “And Tara, aka the person I’m talking to right now, was born a woman. That’s how you can be both at the same time.”
“Precisely.” Tara pulled her close, nearly falling off the ledge in the process. “I told you this because, um... I don’t know how to say the next part without sounding weird.”
Kelly laughed reflexively. “Is it less weird than what you’ve already said?”
“Good... Good point.” She stuttered. “I have friends - actual ‘born that way’ women friends – who would be willing to, you know, merge with you.”
“But why would I -”
“Because...” Tara sighed. “I see what you go through, Kelly. I see you paying good money to a doc who thinks you belong in a nuthouse. If combining with a female will get you what you want, then...”
“Thanks for the offer,” she said, keeping herself anchored to their makeshift bench, “but I’m happy with who I am.”
“O-Okay,” he stammered. “Just know that I love you and that I’m not going anywhere. Really. I’ll always be here for you.”
Kelly gave her a tight hug, sending them both careening to the floor. “Sorry about that. We really need to stop sitting up there.”
Tara smiled and kissed her. “Can I at least sell you on the concept of living forever?”
Ask me in a year,” Kelly said, choosing to lay on the floor. “Now tell me about your past Act, Doctor Who.”
“Act?” Asked Tara.
Kelly nodded. “I look at your life like a play. In Act One, Tara and Theodore remained apart. In Act Two, they became one.”
“I like that,” she said. “And it’s just ‘The Doctor.’ We’ve been over this.” “Whatever.”

In Their Own Words: Kelly Novak
“[...]You have to remember that in those days [the late 20th century], to be transgender was to be permanently on the lam. You came out to your family, who immediately hated and disowned you for being a freak. You then went to Montreal or Thailand or God knows where for what they used to call your – get this – ‘sex change.’ Finally, with whatever little money you had left, you started a new life on the other side of the country. You never saw home or your family again.
I bucked the trend, kind of. Didn’t go to the West Coast. Didn’t feel the need, to be honest. I simply moved from Brownsville [far south of Pittsburgh] to a town just outside of Zelienople called Fombell [far north]. We’re talking about an hour and a half one-way. I got to both disappear and stay close to the area I loved. I thought I won the fucking lottery.
“Shortly after I moved, I found part-time work doing nails at a friend’s beauty salon. About three weeks in, this new person came in off the street asking for a manicure. Never met anyone like her before. She actually treated me like a person, not like a monster or a charity case. I think I gave her the absolute shittiest manicure ever that day, but she didn’t seem to care. ‘See you in a week,’ she said. And... Yeah. She came in every Tuesday, 11 AM sharp, looking for some touch-ups. We got real close real quick.
“I finally asked the woman – Tara, or so she said at the time – out on a date a year or so later. I expected her to say ‘no;’ to run away screaming. Her real answer? ‘But of course. Name the time and place.’ Perfect date. Magical. We moved in together as, ahem, ‘roommates’ two months after.
“So when she told me [about merging], I didn’t bat an eye. Not really. Yeah, the whole ‘living forever’ thing did come off as a little weird at the time. But... I had this secret ‘other life’ too. I lived on the run too. We were... The same. Exactly the same. Definitely meant to be together.”

Westsylvania Tales, Act One: The Life and Times of Kacey Pflugh (1955-2110)

Chapter Two: Let Forever Be
Dateline: The Home of Matt and Penny Wagner, Unionville, WS – Saturday,
November 10th, 2108; 1:40 AM
Tangents, By Theodore Tahrenna: Kacey, at her very best.
Note: The following tale was derived from the stories told by Kasey Pflugh to Harry Wagner on the morning of November 10th, 2108. Corroboration provided by the Three Rivers Swapper Collective. Additional sources will be credited as needed.
Harry Wagner could see the light escaping from the bottom of the door, slowly spilling into the second-floor hallway. He waited a moment from the top of the stairs, hoping that the “situation” on the other side would quickly resolve itself. But alas, the glow held firm. “Jesus...” He mumbled to himself, setting his mostly full glass of water near the top of the staircase. “Last thing I feel like doing right now.” He approached the door with caution, making certain not to set off the faulty, squeak-prone floorboards that occupied their home. A gentle knock. Nothing. “Crap...” A quick twist of the knob followed closely by a well-placed shoulder block. “Grandma Kacey? Are you alright?”
Cassidy Kristen Pflugh – still her legal name, as she never saw the point of having it converted to a G-ID – sat quietly in her reclining hospital bed, a smile on her face and an unwrapped faux-meat snack in her hand. Two watermelon rinds sat on her blanket covered lap. “Hi Harry!” She squeaked, her voice reaching a volume and clarity most her age couldn’t muster. “I got Slimmy Jimmies! Want one?”
“No thanks,” Harry replied, his attention quickly shifting to the accessibility toilet hugging the back wall. “Did you go? Do you need wiped? I can wake up mom and dad if you do.”
“Nope,” she answered instantly. “I woke up and decided I wanted something good.”
“Do you have to go now?”
“Do I?” Kacey thought for moment, her head tilted to the side. “Nah... I’m okay.”
He took a half-step inside the room. “Do you want anything then? More watermelon maybe? Cherry Ludens?”
“Sit with me a bit?” She asked, patting the leftover dining room chair resting comfortably next to her bed.
“Sure.” Harry gingerly shut the abnormally loud door behind him. “Something wrong?”
“Not really, but...” Kacey leaned in, dropping the Slim Jim wrapper onto the rinds at her knees. “You know about me and your grandpa, right? What we do?” She paused. “Well, what he does. My contributions are permanently stuck in the past.”
“You’ve told me dozens of times by this point,” he responded. “The implants, how Acts work... Everything.”
“Do you have your backup yet?” she asked. “You’re old enough, I think.”
7

Harry shook his head. “Grandma, we’ve been over this. I have to wait until I’m eighteen.”
“And you’re... Seventeen right now? I think I could sneak you in without much of a fuss.”
“Thirteen, Grandma.”
“Oh, Right.” She quickly raised her finger in the air. “Y’know Harry, there are ways we could circumvent the current setup. I could always -”
“Please don’t bring up Cousin Del right now,” he blurted out. “Grandpa’s still quietly mad about that.”
“Not surprised,” Kacey replied with a light sigh. “Your grandfather is the love of my life. I never wanted to be with anyone else. That being said, he can be such a pain in my fucking ass sometimes.”
“So I’ve heard.”
She started to chuckle. “Yeah, well... Just make sure -”
“Yes Grandma,” interrupted Harry on cue. “I promise I’ll get a backup going
as soon as I can.”
“And Alyssa too!” She added. “She is sticking around for the long haul, right?” He nodded.
“Good. She’s my granddaughter, you know.”
“I know.” Harry brushed the hair out of his eyes. “Do you need anything else
right now?”
“Give me a minute. I’ll think of something.” Kacey finished off her Slim Jim
and took a sip of water. “You know of that documentary series they keep talking about on the radio? The one about The Setback?”
“Kind of hard not to,” he answered softly, trying not wake up the rest of the house. “They play those ads every five seconds.”
Kacey shook her head. “I’m not telling you what to do, but I won’t be watching. I’ve lived through the whole ordeal once already. That’s more than plenty. Besides, things like that are only interested in showing the bad stuff. No one wants to tell you the whole story.” She looked down, shaking her head. “The producers should’ve called me, you know.”
“Grandpa would love to see you spilling our family secrets on nationwide television,” Harry said with a small grin.
“Yeah, well...” Kacey leaned back in her bed. “Have I ever told you when my first-Act birthday was?”
He shook his head.
“Kristen #1: Born on the Fourth of July 1955 in McKees Rocks, Pennsylvania. Yes, that’s right. Pennsylvania. I ‘m so old that I predate Westsylvanian statehood. Delivered at home because... You know me, Harry. I’m not the ‘waiting’ type.”
“I know,” he said.
“According to my mom, there were neighborhood kids playing with firecrackers outside. She used to tell me -” Kacey took a sudden sip of water. “She used to tell me they were out there celebrating my arrival. That all of the fireworks that happened every year were directly because of me. And I believed it, too. Up till the second grade, actually.”
8

Harry stared, trying desperately to formulate a response. “When...” He hesitated, taking a deep breath instead. “When did you meet Grandpa? The first time, I mean.”
“Early 1981,” she responded. “I had been dating this guy – a real Mingo Junction, him – who had a ‘brother’ he never saw. I decided to hunt ‘him’ down one day, mainly to piss off my soon-to-be ex. That’s when I first ran into a Bohemian computer nerd named Tara and her partner, Kelly.”
“Mingo Junction?” he asked. “As in ‘that town smack dab in the middle of nowhere’ Mingo Junction?”
“The very same.” Kacey laughed to herself. “My dad had a love for funny sounding words and phrases. Every dance was the boogaloo, every soup was ‘pasta fazul’ and every bad boyfriend was a Mingo Junction. More than likely he heard the town mentioned on the news shortly before me and my first ‘winner’ of a date walked in.”
“Okay...” Another deep breath. “And what’s with the air quotes over ‘brother?’”
“...You need to realize something, Harry,” she said hesitantly. “Society back then believed that the core concepts of ‘male’ and ‘female’ were rigid, non- negotiable and locked-in at birth. Men loved women and acted ‘masculine,’ period. Women loved men and acted ‘feminine,’ period. Any person who didn’t play along were considered either deviants, criminals or crazy. I’m serious. They would literally throw you in jail for loving the wrong person.”
“WHAT?!” Harry yelled. “Sorry. Took me by surprise.”
“No, you had the right reaction,” she responded. “Same sex partners didn’t become decriminalized in the Pittsburgh area until the summer of 1980. ‘Decriminalized’ meant you were still breaking the law, but you wouldn’t get into trouble.”
“...Well that’s scary...” He rubbed his eyes nervously. “So, Kelly and almost- Grandpa were borderline criminals at one point.”
“Worse. My boyfriend’s sibling... I knew her as ‘Kelly,’ but she started as ‘Kevin.’ Real double whammy there.”
“And your boyfriend -”
“Hated his sister’s guts, as did the rest of their family, for being herself. Shame too. Kelly and Tara were a million times more fun than they could ever be.” Kacey grabbed another Slim Jim from the glass on her nightstand. “I met Kristen #2 through them. We ended up merging... Shit... I want to say the summer of 1999. July, maybe?”
“Oh wow...” Harry trailed off, using the moment to take a Slim Jim for himself. “Is that how Kristen #2 met Cassidy?”
“Thanks to a few close calls in the late 2000s, not to mention Theodore Tahrenna spilling his guts to Canada’s favorite rock star several times over, Kristen #2 and Cassidy never met,” she answered. “Not allowed. ‘Zero loose ends,’ as your grandfather used to say. I simply received an envelope with an earpiece from my mentor. Carrie. She goes by ‘Caroline’ these days.”
“When did you first meet Grandpa?” He stopped himself. “Again. Met grandpa again.”
Kacey smiled. “That depends on the definition of ‘met,’ Harry.”

Chapter Three: A Boy Named Sue
Dateline: The Apartment of Cassidy and Delilah Wagner, Pittsburgh (Oakland), PA –
Thursday, March 14th, 2030; 7:30 PM
Comments, by Dr. Caroline Roberts: Life before The Setback.
Note: Certain era-specific technical details were provided by Tara Sharpe and Theodore Tahrenna.
“Cassie!” Delilah Wagner yelled from their shared kitchen/dining room/auxiliary living space. “Cassie!”
Cassie Wagner stuck her head partway out the door, her red, wire-framed glasses sitting on her nose and a sour expression fixed to her face. “What?!” she hissed. “I have a history exam tomorrow! This better be important!”
“Your phone keeps buzzing. I think your mystery man is finally trying to make contact.” Delilah pushed her hair, a newly minted shade of blue, back into position near her right eye. “I’d probably answer the next one if I -”
The smartphone, a silver slab wrapped in a bright pink, rubberized shell, began to shake and twitch.
“Shit!” Cassie’s heart began to race. Her breathing became quick and abnormally heavy. “I... Oh God. This is happening. This is really, really happening...”
“Calm down,” Delilah responded, snatching a few important items from the counter. “There is nothing to worry about. They love you down there according to Ms. Roberts.”
“I... I know,” she stammered. “But now... Things are real now.”
“And I get that. But...” Delilah placed the equipment in her sister’s hands. “You need to handle your business, Cassie.”
She nodded, pressing the large green ‘answer’ button at the bottom of the screen. “H-Hello?”
<Beep>
Tara: This is Tara Pflugh calling from the Three Rivers Bar and Grill. With whom do I have the pleasure of speaking to this evening?
“C-C-Cassidy Wagner - Cassie,” she stuttered. “You have the right number.”
Tara: Good. The line is encrypted, correct?
“Y-Yes sir. I’m using Cap’n Crunch, just like Carrie told me told to. I...” Cassie’s eyes grew wide. Her stomach dropped to the floor. “Shit! Ma’am! I meant ‘ma’am!’ I am so sorry for offending you like that.”
Tara: [Chuckling] I appreciate your consideration, but you were correct the first time. Think of me as the boy named ‘Sue,’ only without the pronounced violent streak.
10

“Sue?” She asked nervously. “I don’t know him. Her! They! Whoever! Oh God... This is going terribly...”
Tara: Are you familiar with the late great Johnny Cash?
“Y-Yeah. He sings that ‘Hurt’ song that makes my mom cry.” Cassie slowly dropped to the floor. “Did he sing about this ‘Sue’ character, too?”
Tara: Yes, amongst hundreds of others. Promise me you’ll look him up as soon as we disconnect.
“I will,” she replied.
Tara: Good. [Pause] Before we begin, I need to ask a few basic questions. Is that alright?
“Sure. Go ahead.”
Tara: Wonderful. [Pause] What is your primary device?
“Samsung Galaxy S 20th Anniversary Edition,” answered Cassie. “Rooted, by the way.”
Tara: Makes both of our lives easier. [Slight pause] And your OS?
“Fuchsia 10.2 Jade. I ditched both Tizen and those shitty Chinese/European Android knockoffs a long, long time ago.”
Tara: I do love how you keep saying all the right things. [Pause] Do you have our app?
“Yes. Carrie gave it to me earlier.” Cassie took a deep, choppy breath. “All ready to go.”
Tara: Good. [Pause] My next
few statements are going to sound a little strange. Have you been briefed on their intended meaning?
“I have...”
Tara: Alright then. First question: Have you received your gift yet?
 A Beginner’s Guide to Smartphones:
App: A tool, service or experience that made a smartphone worth using. Apps occupied the “middle ground” between modern auxiliary implant upgrades and AR feeds.
Operating System (OS): The engine that powered smartphones, computers and numerous other technologies of the day. Modern implant interfaces are, in a way, an evolution of the OS concept.
Android: An incredibly popular and versatile OS created by pre-Setback technology concern Google. In addition to smartphones, versions of Android could be found on watches, televisions and even automobiles.
Fuchsia: Google’s official replacement for Android. Despite being popular amongst hobbyists and industry professionals, Fuchsia did not have nearly the following of its predecessor.
Tizen: A compact, highly controversial and widely disliked Android alternative developed and championed by smartphone manufacturer Samsung.
11

Cassie stared at the object in her hands. To the outside observer, the device appeared to be nothing more than an outdated earpiece designed for wireless phone calls. But she knew better. This device was the key to everything. “I have the gift in my hands as we speak,” she responded.
Tara: Is the concierge ready to receive their guest for the evening?
“As ready as they’ll ever be.”
Tara: Are you aware that the guest will be staying for precisely two and a half Gone with the Winds?
“I am.”
Tara: And what will you do with your gift once the guest settles in?
“...Smash the device with something heavy and throw the pieces into as many different garbage cans as possible?” She asked.
Tara: Unorthodox, but perfectly acceptable. [Pause] How does one deal with a hangover?
“Stay in bed all day with the television and radio off.”
Tara: And finally, do you have any questions for the management?
“Just one,” she found herself blurting out. “Have you ever danced with the devil in the pale moonlight?”
Tara: [After a long pause] I’m afraid that I don’t fully understand the question.
“Promise me you’ll watch the Michael Keaton Batman as soon as you get home,” replied Cassie.
Tara: Ah, yes. My tastes in late 20th century genre cinema skews more towards Blade Runner and RoboCop than Batman and Robin. [Pause] I have but one final question: Are you ready?
“I am.”
Tara: Okay then. I hope to speak to again you soon.
<Beep>
With that, the line went dead. Cassie leaned her head against the frame of the door and briefly closed her eyes.
“Well?” Inquired Delilah from the other room. “Everything good?”
 Tara’s Coded Words in Plain English: Concierge: The host – Cassie, in this
case.
Guest: The person Cassie will be merging with.
Gone with the Wind: A measurement of time based upon the length of the aforementioned classic film. One Gone with the Wind is equal to four hours.
Hangover: The first 24 hours after a merger.
12

“Oh yes,” she said. “He seems nice. Well... Nice for a person who has never seen the 1989 Batman, at any rate.”
“I guess you’ll be missing your exam then...” Cassie could hear Delilah’s kitchen chair rubbing against the worn linoleum floor. ““And you’re absolutely sure about this? You can always change your mind, you know.”
“I... I am. I have zero idea why, but I am.” She forced herself to stand and stretch. “Don’t let anyone know that you know. I could get into a lot of trouble.”
“Who would I tell?” Delilah shot back, now standing directly in front of her. “No one would believe me!”
“Good point,” Cassie replied, nervously adjusting her glasses. “I’m going to be busy for a while tonight. Tomorrow, too. Don’t bug me.”
“I won’t.” Delilah gave her a hug. “I hope this goes well for you.”
“Me too. Night, Del,” she said.
Cassie slammed the door behind her and fell to her bed, both the “gift” and
her phone still in hand. “Computer! Play ‘A Boy Named Sue’ by Johnny Cash.” “Oh Johnny, what did I get myself into?” She mumbled, the music quickly
filling the room.

Chapter Four: No Roots
Dateline: Three Rivers Bar and Grill, Pittsburgh (Strip District), PA –Wednesday,
March 31st, 2030; 6:58 PM
Diatribes, by DL Christie: On corner of 15th Street and Smallman sat a sports bar without any visible signage or name. The establishment, of the surface at least, stayed afloat on the collective desire to watch contact sports with others. But if one were to look closer...
Dining room; corner booth.
Seven semi-recognizable figures (and one instantly recognizable history professor) sat around the horseshoe shaped enclosure, each one engaged in a sizeable slice of a shared conversation. The moment, especially to a person not used to social interaction in public spaces, seemed downright alien. But a small part of her – a part that seemingly grew bigger and more pronounced every second – felt like she had returned home. She approached the table with caution, careful not to interrupt any sudden, salient points or humorous hot takes.
“...And that’s why Asimov’s Three Laws wouldn’t apply in this case,” a voice said, their mouth full of a yet unidentified, seemingly edible substance. “They were just talking this in Publication Fantastique. You can’t have -”
The person looked up, quickly making eye contact. “Hey! The new Act finally showed up! We were beginning to wonder about you! What are you going by these days?”
“C-Cassie for now,” she stuttered as she clumsily sat at the end of the booth. “The memories from before are still a little vague. I’m not sure what I like yet name- wise.”
“Always takes some time.” The person paused, taking the moment to adjust their worn knit cap. “My personal record for full integration is six months.”
“Seven months for me,” another said in a thick Australian accent.
“Eight months and sixteen -”
The bespectacled man seated at the head of the table leaned forward, careful
not to place his exposed elbows on the serving area in front of him. The rest of the dining party fell silent. “Welcome Cassie,” he said calmly. “This is your... Third Act, correct?”
“Y-Yeah...” She mumbled. “I... I think.”
“I remember number three,” a long-haired woman across from her reminisced. “One of my favorites.”
“...But we’re in our third Act now,” the bearded man sitting beside her retorted.
She smiled. “And it’s one of my favorites.”
“Bought the Windmill Mini-Golf on my Third Act,” added the person in the dark blue pants-suit. “Love that place. Me and -”
“My apologies in advance,” interrupted the man in the glasses, “but I think Cassie deserves our undivided attention right now. We can gush over our life choices at a later date.”
14

The pants-suit nodded.
“Thank you.” The man paused for a brief moment, his expression holding firm. “Since you still don’t have all of your memories back, I think a brief reintroduction is in order. Start with me and go around counter-clockwise, as per usual?”
The occupants nodded unanimously.
“Good. My name is Tara Pflugh. I am currently on my third Act, 100 years cumulative. My pronouns are ‘he/his/him.’ I own this bar and, as you no doubt have heard, discovered the process of merging two separate people into one body.”
He gestured to the woman on his right.
“Me already? Damn.” She cleared her throat. “Kelly Novak: Act two, 85-ish years cumulative, she/hers/her. My contributions are all of these fun words we use. ‘Act?’ ‘Cumulative age?’ ‘Swapping?’ All mine. I’m also the genius who thought of running our little ‘secret society’ out of a bar. I’m pretty much a visionary.”
“Right.” Cassie tilted her head. “I’m sorry, but I don’t have a damn clue what any of those words mean.”
Kelly smirked. “You see, a ‘bar’ is a magical place where...”
“Cute, Kel,” Cassie shot back with a level of confidence and quickness she usually didn’t possess. “Okay... Fine. I get ‘Act.’ But what’s with the age thing? Is that when the first Act version of you was born?”
“Exactly,” Tara responded.
“Glad to get one right off the bat.” She took a breath. “But what about ‘swapping?’ What the hell is that? Sounds like what would happen if characters in a Cyberpunk novel started sleeping with each other's spouses.”
The person in the knit cap immediately started to laugh. “I told you Kristen would make the ‘swingers’ joke! Al-Stu owes me $50!”
“But ‘Kristen’ didn’t say anything,” reasoned the bearded person beside him. “Cassie did. The bet only goes down if the Kristens and Cassie are fully integrated, which they clearly are not.”
“But I contend integration doesn’t matter in this case. That answer couldn’t have come from anyone but the Kristens. We might as well start calling her ‘KC’ right now.” The person stuck out their right hand. “Fifty, Al-Stu. Right here.”
“But we wouldn’t even be doing the intros again if the Kristens were truly active,” replied the pants-suit. “The bet is still on; no money changes hands.”
“But...” The person in the knit cap sighed. “Fine.”
“And there’s no way the upcoming amalgamation could be ‘KC,’” observed Kelly. “I mean, the Kristens are going into Cassie. Cassie is still large and in charge. The end result would have to be ‘CK.’”
“But why -”
Tara gently clapped, bringing the argument to a halt. “Getting back on track here...”
“Right.” The person in the knit cap cracked their knuckles. “I’m Theodore Tahrenna – 78 years old cumulative; Act ‘I’m not telling.’ He/his/him. I...”
“...Am going to divulge your Act number to CK,” the familiar figure, known to Cassie as “Ms. Roberts,” finished. “You can’t keep that a secret forever, Theo.”
“Watch me.” He took a sip of his Stella. “As for what I do around here...”

“You’re the hippie uncle who only shows up when they need a couch to crash on, right?” Inquired the Australian. “I’m pretty sure we can get by fine without one of those stuffing up the works.”
“Nope!” Theodore threw his arm around Tara. “I’m the official Guinea pig. This guy here tests all of his breakthroughs on himself, then me. None of you would be here without my innate ability to not die horribly.”
“There is a kernel of truth to that boast,” Tara informed them. “Who’s next?”
“That would be me,” volunteered the bearded man next to Theodore. He adjusted his polo shirt and smartwatch, continuing soon after. “My name is Alexander Stuart Antoline – 77 years old cumulative; Act three. He/his/him. Everyone knows me as ‘Alex,’ save for Theo. He still calls me -”
“Al-Stu,” he bellowed, “Just like in high school. I remember this one time, me and him had to dispose of a mattress. So we were driving by the Wal-Mart in Center when -”
“Yeah... Let’s not go there,” said the woman to his right. She slowly brushed away her hair, a gravity-enhanced waterfall of brown, and smirked. “Diane –78 cumulative, she/hers/her. Act three; which is still my favorite, by the way. Alex is my husband. And together... Let’s say we’re the only two people here who know how to truly ‘get things done.’ Things other people can’t fathom.”
“Hit-couple. Gotcha.” Cassie smiled, waiting in vain for an equivalent reaction. A reaction that, for one reason or another, never came. “Oh... Um... You’re serious. Remind me to never get on your bad sides, then.”
Alex shook his head. “We aren’t hit people. We wouldn’t know how to use a high-powered sniper rifle even if our lives depended on it.”
“Of course not.” Kelly paused. “They’re document forgers! Best two I’ve ever seen. I’m pretty sure the Fayette County Courthouse still has the ‘she’s a biological female, I swear’ birth certificate they cooked up for Act one in a file cabinet somewhere.”
“Oh wow,” Cassie muttered, grabbing a filled glass of water sitting towards the center. “I have one small question then, if you don’t mind me asking.”
“Sure.”
“How do yinz... Um...” Cassie took a sip. “How do I put this without sounding nebby...”
“...Stay together through our various Acts?” Diane finished, a wry smile forming on her lips. “That, my dear CK, is a trade secret. One that we don’t necessarily want to divulge at the moment. Our methodology can get pretty complex.”
Theodore started to laugh. “Allow me to explain things simply, then. They find a couple in a happy, committed relationship, then merge with them. Repeat as necessary; lay flat to dry. How close am I?”
“Can’t say,” Alex replied, his expression hidden by a well-placed hand to the chin. “Trade secret. I think you’ll understand.”
Cassie nodded, adding: “Any kids?”
“Oh fuck no!” Blurted Diane. “Swappers would make terrible parents. Besides, could you really see us with a kid?”
“Baby goat or baby human?” Inquired the Australian. “That’s an important distinction to make.”
16

“Interesting question.” Diane turned to Alex. “Want to get a goat? We can name him ‘Alex Junior!’”
Alex simply shook his head. “I would, but the plumbing surplus store we live on top has a strict no barnyard animal policy. If we can -”
“We can explore this line of thinking later,” Tara interrupted, allowing the conversation to die down before moving forward. “Now that we have that out of the way, who are we on?”
“Me, I think,” answered the woman in the pants-suit.
Tara nodded. “The floor is yours, then.”
“Great.” She turned, her legs now accidentally invading Cassie’s personal
space. “Jenna McGregor, 90 years old cumulative, she/hers/her. This is my fourth Act.”
“Four?” Cassie asked, astonished. “That has to be the record to beat.” “Officially...” Theodore let slip from the corner of his mouth.
“Ignore him.” Jenna waited a few moments before continuing. “Anyway... I’m
the ‘money’ person around here. I keep this place up and running.”
“Yep,” chimed Theodore yet again. “Our group is an empire. An empire built
on a rock-solid foundation of stupid shit that makes a ton of money for no reason. You know... Like the Windmill in Hopewell and the Baden Bowl.”
“Well that’s a major comedown,” Cassie commented in a tone she wasn’t quite used to. “I mean, we went from ‘forgery’ to ‘bowling alley’ in one move. The new person on the end there better not be a CPA or something. I don’t want this introduction to spin into a boredom freefall.”
Ms. Roberts poked her head in. “Just to be clear, are you -”
“Yes Carrie. I’m most definitely saying that ‘beloved history professor’ is infinitely more boring than owning a bowling alley and the mini-golf in Hopewell. I...” Cassie stopped herself, a horrified expression draping her face. “Dear lord I’m so sorry. I honestly don’t know what just happened there.”
“The Kristens happened,” responded Diane. “Totally natural.”
Cassie fell backwards into the booth. “But... But that’s not me! I would never...” She paused. “Or would I? I don’t even know anymore! Am I still me?”
“CK needs a refresher,” commented Kelly. “Who’s turn is it?”
“The Kristens,” answered most of the table simultaneously.
“Allow me to fill in then,” said Tara, instantly grabbing her attention. “What
you are going through is a merger, not a hostile takeover. You, as the rightful owner of this body, have full control over how the Kristens are integrated into your everyday life. You can have them play an active part in your day-to-day decision- making, or you can use their experiences as educational tools. Either way, they won’t and can’t make do anything you wouldn’t do.”
“But... But...” Cassie rubbed her temples in confusion. “They have to be doing something! I would never talk to Ms. Roberts that way otherwise!”
“Not your history professor, no,” Ms. Roberts retorted. “But you would talk to Carrie, your best friend since the first-term of Ronnie Reagan, that way. My guess is you deal with those close to you in a similar manner as the Kristens did. That reaction wouldn’t have surfaced if you didn’t.”
“And you’d be right,” she replied. “The problem is, you and I don’t...”
17

Cassie stopped cold; a wide variety of personal snippets connected to Ms. Roberts – Carrie – rushing through her mind. A minute here, a half-minute there. Nothing concrete or substantial, but enough. And ‘enough’ was all that she needed at the moment.
“Never mind. I get what yinz are saying... I think.” She looked over. “Just to make sure: These memories I have floating around all the sudden... They’re real, right?”
“Oh yes,” said Tara.
“That’s good.” She took a sip of water. “What’ll happen when I run across one the Kristens’ bad memories? Will I be screwed up for life – lives?”
“Not exactly.” Tara straightened the glasses on the bridge of his nose. “Let’s pretend for a moment you get a flat tire on one of our state’s many glamorous potholes. And let’s say you then realize you have no spare tire, no Fix-a-flat and that you forgot to renew your AAA. How would you feel?”
“Pissed,” she answered immediately. “Really pissed.”
“As we all would,” inserted Jenna. “Goddamn PennDOT jobs. Takes seven people to do the work of three.”
Tara cleared his throat. “We’re drifting again...”
Jenna nodded. “Sorry.”
“Quite alright.” He turned his head back to Cassie’s general direction. “Now
then: Let’s say you decide to ‘revisit’ that very incident fifteen years later. How would you most likely react to that memory?”
“I’d laugh about it,” Cassie responded. “I mean, that’s just ‘life’ stuff. Happens to everybody. No need to get all bent out of shape.” She tilted her head. “Is this how the Kristens’ combined life experiences will ultimately register? Like a flat tire on the Turnpike fifteen years ago?”
“Yes,” Tara confirmed. “You’ll still remember the moment, but the reactions attached – not to mention any unneeded negativity derived from those reactions - will be completely stripped away. This allows you to both learn from your failures and build from your successes without excess emotions clouding your judgement.”
Theodore snapped his fingers. “Hey Tara... taggin’ in for a minute. You forgot the end bit again.”
“I know.” Tara gestured with his hands. “The floor is yours.”
“Great.” Theodore rolled up the sleeves on his worn, red flannel, placing his bare elbows on the tabletop. “Tara’s right: Emotions connected to memories from your previous Acts go out the window the second a merger happens. But that doesn’t mean experiences from your past can’t still make you emotional.”
“Um... Okay...” Cassie mumbled. “That doesn’t sound like a complete contradiction at all.”
“Let me tell you a story, then.” Theodore sighed loudly, his jovial body language all but disappearing. “About fourteen years ago give or take, a very, very close friend of mine died of brain cancer. He looked like shit by the end. His memory gotsobad,hehadtowritemynameonhishand.Itriedtogethimtojoinupafew times, but...” Eyes closed; hands covering. “I’m just going to stop here, if that’s fine.”
“God yes,” she replied. “I’m so sorry.”
“Yeah, well...” He shook his head. “The kneejerk emotions I felt at various key moments – when I first heard about the diagnosis, his refusals of my offers, his... You
18

know – are all long gone. But as you can see, I still get upset when he’s brought up. I will always miss my friend, no matter what I look like this week.”
“Do those gut punches start to dull after a bit?” Inquired Cassie. “Degrade over time?”
“You’d think so, wouldn’t you?” He took a long drink from his half-empty glass of Stella. “But no. Those feelings of loss actually get more intense after you merge.”
She shot back to her original position. “What?! Why?!”
“Simple,” Theodore responded. “I didn’t have the survivor’s guilt and generalized regret of the moment to hide behind anymore. I had to face this gigantic, gaping hole in my life head-on.”
“This leads to an interesting side effect though,” added Alex. “The more ‘old bullshit’ you successfully stare down, the easier it is to deal with whatever new bullshit comes down the pike. You get so used to acting like the emotional equivalent of an action hero that ancillary shit like the survivor’s guilt, like the in- the-moment regret, becomes a nonfactor.”
The Australian woman pounded the edge of the table. “Exactly, mate. That’s not to say we all don’t go pear shaped when faced with a horrible situation every once and again. Lord knows I did when me and Theo’s relationship went tits up. But the little shits that make us lose the plot... They don’t get ya of ya bike now, y’know?”
Cassie rubbed her shoulders nervously. “Um... Not to be rude or anything, but who are you again? I remember everyone else in one way or another, but I’m drawing a blank with you.”
“Jackie, love,” she responded with a polite laugh. “Jackie DeNucci, Brizzy proud 66 years on, Act two. Teed up a flight just to meet you. I’m a sheila, so I stick to all the words that usually go with. That’s not to say I don’t get on with everyone and their mum who likes to use something else. Just not for me.”
“Okay, then.” She forced herself to make eye contact with Theodore. “Can I get a translation? I don’t speak ‘Aussie slang’ well yet. Or at all.”
“No problem,” he answered. “Jackie here is 66 years old cumulative from Brisbane. She’s in her second Act and prefers she/hers/her. She also – and correct me if I’m wrong – runs the Southeast Queensland swapper collective.”
She nodded, smiling. “Yep. I’m in charge of both the upper New South Wales crew out of Coolangatta/Tweed Heads and a satellite group in Jimboomba as well. Those nillwits would cark it without me.”
“Neat. I -”
“Excuse me,” interjected Carrie faux-angrily. “You skipped right over me! Not that I’m anyone important. I’m simply the person who brought you here to begin
with!”
“Best for last,” reassured Theodore.
“Of course. I -”
“I got this one.” Cassie took a comically large breath. “You’re Carrie Roberts:
Third Act, 88 years cumulative. Pronouns are she/hers/her. Officially speaking, you have a PhD in history. But since you earned said doctorate in your second Act, you’ve been relegated to mere ‘history nerd’ for the time being.”
19

“History professor,” she corrected. “I still have a master’s degree. If you want to speak to a history ‘nerd,’ talk to Tara.”
“We all think the Romans were a society full of hedonists who didn’t give a shit about the rule of law,” Tara said with a smirk. “And don’t get me wrong: They were. But they were also...” He paused. “Oh... You were saying?”
“I...” Carrie turned her head towards him. “...Have lost my train of thought. Thanks. Really. Thanks for that.”
“My pleasure,” Tara replied, tapping his glass with a loose fork. “Now, as is tradition whenever a new Act begins, I am going to ask one simple question: What are the guidelines every Swapper lives by?”
“Swapping should be treated as a big deal,” said Alex. “I mean, you do literally have someone else’s life in your hands.”
“Yeah,” echoed Diane. “Treat the people you used to be with respect.”
“...But keep your damn mouth shut,” Kelly added. “Don’t go to Insta or DLA or... Off the top of my head here... A certain Canadian hero the press wouldn’t leave be, Theodore.”
“Yes,” Jackie began, “But you also need to share the love with someone you can trust.”
Jenna nodded. “Of course. Living forever in solitude just sounds terrible.”
“And make sure you keep your Collection safe,” Carrie continued as she tapped Cassie on the shoulder. “That reminds me: See me before you leave. I have the keys to your self-storage lockers in my car.”
“Cool.” Cassie waited a beat. “What’s a ‘Collection?’”
“All of the items and mementos that belonged to your previous Acts,” Tara explained. “These collectables are integral to your overarching story. It’s Carrie’s job to keep them safe.”
“Oh... And make sure you live a little,” Theodore finished. “I mean, we are essentially immortal beings. You have the time to get the most out each Act.”
“On that note...” Tara lifted his left hand with a flourish, prompting the others to raise their glasses. “On behalf of all that have come before, we welcome you, Cassidy ‘CK’ Wagner, to the Three Rivers Swapper Collective. Salud!”
“Salud!” They replied, taking a celebratory drink soon after.
Cassie was beaming. For the first time, she felt finally found her compatriots. Her equals. Her friends. “Thank you for the warm welcome,” she said. “That said, there is one tiny thing I need to address.”
“But of course,” Tara responded.
“You asked me what I liked earlier. And ‘CK...’” She mentally counted down from ‘five.’ “...Sucks really badly. For that reason, I’m going with ‘K.C.’ – no, ‘Kacey’ – instead. I know that’s totally backwards, but I like the sound.”
“To Kacey,” they all said in unison, taking another drink. “To me!” Kacey exclaimed, joining in joyously.

Chapter Five: Never Be Blue
Dateline: Three Rivers Bar and Grill, Pittsburgh (Strip District), PA – Wednesday,
February 11th, 2032; 7:03 PM
Tangents, By Theodore: Same friends, different faces... Plus or minus two, of
course.
“Sorry I’m late,” Kacey groaned, slipping into her “spot’’ at the end of the booth. “Been one of those days where the shit just doesn’t stop.”
“I know the feeling,” responded Kelly, moving her water glass out of the way. “Makes you wonder why you even bothered going out in the morning.”
“Oh yes. Doesn’t help that the universe coordinates the traffic lights just to fuck with me. This is a quantifiable fact proven by science, by the way.” Kacey looked towards the head of the table. “And why the hell isn’t Tara here yet? Been at least a month or two. Show your face!”
“That’s on me,” informed Carrie. “Getting the necessary equipment out of the old Act’s apartment proved to be a bit of a challenge thanks to the Pittsburgh Police Department. But you’ll be happy to know that he’s merging with his mystery man as we speak.”
“Fantastic.” Kacey smiled. “And thanks for being so honest. I like having someone to blame.”
“Oh, I know,” Carrie smirked.
“Now that we’re all here...” Theodore adjusted his knit cap, now a half-size bigger than his head, and firmly planted his elbows on the table. “Who wants to
start?”
“Got a promotion at work,” Al-Stu volunteered, his mouth full Buffalo wings
and blue cheese dressing. “The job’s been open for about a year. The higher ups couldn’t find anyone to match the previous person’s ‘unique’ qualifications out in the wild, so they were forced to go in-house. Turns out I have the exact same level of knowledge he did. How about that for a coincidence?”
“Gotta love the tech industry. Experience, not degrees.” Kacey leaned in; her left arm pressed against the edge of the table. “Friend of yours?”
“We ran in similar circles,” he explained, a small grin peeking through. “He had one of those 1970s, ‘semi-mowed lawn’ hippie beards that never looked quite right, no matter what his friends told him.”
The entire dining party stifled a laugh.
“Really nice guy though,” Al-Stu continued. “The type of person who would let his couch surfing best friend from high school crash in his basement for months on end. He didn’t ask for rent!”
“And what a basement!” Exclaimed Theodore, “...Or so I’ve heard...”
Al-Stu took a long sip of his Penn Pilsner, hiding whatever reaction he might have had. “Moving on... I guess his wife passed soon after. Kind of sweet – true love
n’at.”
“Speaking of...” He paused, putting his arm around the woman next to him.
“Didn’t you know her, Diane?”
21

“You can say that...” she commented, sporting a wry smile.
“We ended up buying their entire estate a few months ago on the cheap,” Al- Stu mumbled through his wings. “Got lucky there. Turns out he and I were into the exact same things.”
Diane nodded. “Didn’t hurt that the agent running the sale is a friend of ours. I’m pretty sure Jenna knows her.”
“I do,” Jenna inserted, her Iron City well in hand. “I hear she’s running the Windmill mini-golf in Hopewell these days.”
Carrie stuck her pointer in the air. “...And the Baden Bowl. Can’t forget the Bowl.”
“Of course. They’re a matched set, after all.” Jenna brushed the hair out of eyes. “In other news, I finally got a date and time for my surgery: October 7th, eight in the morning.”
“Congratulations!” Blurted Theodore, nearly knocking over his Stella in the process. “Where you headed? Montreal? Heard good things about the crew up
there.”
“Downtown Philly.”
Theodore simply shook his head.
“I know, I know. Better than nothing, right?” Jenna paused, allowing a well- placed sigh to slip in undetected. “I’m going to need someone to go with me. My goddamn transphobe... I mean ‘gender critical’ sister has successfully convinced the rest of my family that I’m either a ‘trender’ or a patriarchal extremist. Changes from day-to-day.”
“Asshole...” stated Kacey.
“Par for the course with that crowd.” Jenna shook her head. “Goddamn keyboard genderfrees. Decade-plus of this shit with no signs of stopping.”
Kelly raised her hand immediately. “I’ll go. I’m a seasoned pro at this sort of thing.”
“Great,” replied Jenna. “We’ll talk later.”
“And speaking of major news...” Theodore gestured toward Kacey. “Thank you, Theo,” she said. “I got to Facetime with Jackie the other day. I
completely forgot that two in the afternoon around here is four in the morning for her.”
“Happens to all of us,” reassured Diane, stealing a wing from Al-Stu’s plate along the way.
“Good to know I’m not the only one who can’t figure out time zones.” Kacey chuckled, tying her hair back in a purposefully sloppy manner.
“Jackie’s doing great by the way. I guess she has plans to start a new Collective independent of everything else on the Gold Coast.” She took a quick sip of someone’s water. “...Or the Sunshine Coast. Whatever. Australia’s a weird place. All I know is that some coast near Brisbane is going to be overrun with Swappers very, very soon.”
“The other thing going on,” Theodore prodded. “The one I’m dying to talk about.”
“Oh yeah...” Kacey made herself comfortable, pressing her back against the concave angle where the physical booth the decorative oak end piece met.
22

“Accidentally ran into this nervous guy at the Cathedral of Learning the other day. Short, blue vest, pocket watch. Kind of looked like a manager from the Applebee’s.”
“I know the type,” commented Jenna. “Train conductor without a train.”
“Exactly,” Kacey took a somewhat deep breath, if for no other reason than to burn through a few thoroughly unnecessary seconds. “We got to chatting because... Well... You know me. I’m a master bullshitter. I could talk a leg off a chair. He eventually told me his name was Owen. He’s a Senior, like me. Comp-Sci major.”
“You like to talk?” interjected Kelly sarcastically. “You?”
“I choose to take that as a complement,” she happily shot back. “Anyway,
Owen told me his mentor wanted him to do something... A bit odd, shall we say. Some crazy sounding nonsense involving Bluetooth earpieces and Gone with the Wind. Didn’t make much sense to him, but he had learned early on not to question too much. I guess his ‘fearless leader’ – Tara, I think he said – had a rep for being a little ‘mysterious’ sometimes.”
“You met Owen?” Asked Carrie immediately. “Do you realize the crap I had to go through to keep yinz apart? How did he get in touch with you? How did he even know of you?”
“Total fluke, as I said.”
“Fifty-some years of flawlessly keeping candidates and the Collective apart ruined by a chance meeting at the Cathy and annoying cops,” lamented Carrie.
“Sorry from breaking your perfect game.” Kacey waited a beat. “Now would be a good time to remind you that in moments like these, a little ‘industrial-strength palm grease’ never hurt anyone. Just sayin’.”
“I’ll keep that in mind for the next time.” She rubbed her eyes. “Good thing Tara isn’t here right now. Don’t feel like hearing the lecture. ‘No loose ends, Caroline...’”
The entire group began to look at each other.
“Um... Carrie?” Diane finally spoke up. “Tara and Owen merged like a week ago. If he doesn’t know yet, he will very, very soon.”
“I... Dammit! The one time -”
Theodore snapped his fingers, bringing the booth’s verbal energy to a sudden
stop.
“Watching a distinguished professor slowly and methodically melt down is
very interesting and all,” he began, “but is sadly distracting us from Kacey’s monumental announcement. So, please: Speak up before I have a meltdown of my own.”
A million useless thoughts poured through Kacey’s mind, forming a dark, ever-present voice.
Cassie Wagner and ‘The Kristens’ proudly present: What Could Possibly Be This Damn Important?
      Paying the cable bill on time for once in my life?
      Important, but not worth derailing an entire
      conversation over.
  23

Remembering to plug in my hybrid instead of coasting on gasoline?
The planet might be cheering, but the table wouldn’t care.
      Is he waiting to hear how I decided to go vegetarian
      last week?
See number two. Also, there’s a high probability that at least three members would order extra meat as an “offset.”
      Then what could...
“...The house, Kacey,” interrupted Theodore. “You bought a house, remember?”
“Oh yeah...”
She put her head back to its intended position as the rest of her friends waited for a follow-up. “To be clear, the Kristens bought a house. That’s their money I’m using, not mine. I’m not even through school yet.”
“...And for the trillionth time, the Kristens are a part of you,” Carrie clarified. “That’s your money. ‘This is mine/that’s yours’ shouldn’t exist between yinz anymore.”
Jenna nodded, adding: “You really need to get past that mental block, Kacey. Seriously.”
“I’m trying. As for the house...” She took a moment to mentally steady herself. Deep breath, in and out.
“This really isn’t that big of a deal, gang,” Kacey stated. “I’m going to be living between an auto salvage yard and a perpetually unfinished real estate development. There might be a thing of ducks living in the tool shed. The damn place used to run on oil heat! I got a steal!”
“You need to understand something,” Kelly explained calmly. “Not everyone here chooses to be quite as ‘disconnected’ with their previous Acts as you. Now, I’m not saying you’re ‘Tara’ or anything. No one is as partitioned with his past selves as him. But you don’t... ‘Play up’ the old days in the way that Theo or I might.”
“And I realize this. But I don’t ...”
      Shit! Figured it out!
“Yinz think like old farts,” Kacey blurted out, not giving herself enough time to think her words through. “And there is nothing an old fart loves more than hearing about when young people buy houses.”
Theodore nodded vigorously. “That’s right. So please, start talking. Leave no avenue unexplored.”
“Um...” She scratched her shoulder. “Let me take a few questions from the floor. I think that might be my best bet right now.”
“Where are you ending up?” Asked Carrie.
24

“Somewhere between Zelienople and Rochester – New Sewickley Township, I think,” she responded. “I think I might be near Alex and Diane, actually.”
“One floor or two?” Jenna snuck in.
“One, but there’s a crappy basement. Nothing fun. There isn’t even an emergency toilet in the middle of the floor.”
“Did you sign up for your landline yet?” Theodore inquired. “Verizon is all but giving those away these days.”
“No...” Kacey waited a beat. “Should I?”
“Oh yes,” Al-Stu commented. “Getting reliable cell service out by us is a challenge and a half.”
“Our high-tech infrastructure really needs some work as well,” added Diane. “The sort of, kind of cul-de-sac down the road still has telegraph lines running to their respective houses. Having a backup just in case the internet goes down is a good idea.”
Kacey nodded, smirking. “Why not? Hell... I’ll even get one of those corded phones like I had in the 80s’ – eye-melting pink with the terrible sound quality.”
“We have one of those old Sports Illustrated football phones hooked up in the one room,” said Al-Stu. “Can’t believe the thing still works.”
“People!” Theodore barked. “Footballs and eyesores... Those might be fine for the average landline user, but not us. We’re Swappers. Folks like us deserve an elite- level communication device. Something substantial. Something memorable. Something... Brown.”
“You’re describing the football phone to a tee, man,” Al-Stu informed him. Theodore shook his head. “No. Two words: Rotary telephone.”
“...Which I found in Kristen #1’s storage locker last week.” Kacey paused.
“Didn’t expect a serious answer, did yinz?”
“Not in the -” Carrie stopped cold, immediately shifting focus to her phone. A
sigh soon followed.
“Everything okay?” Kelly inquired.
“Got a text from Owen. He wants me to bring him a veggie burger. I don’t
mind going, but...” She shook her head. “...Oakland is in the complete opposite direction from home.”
“I’ll go,” said Kacey. “I’m still living around there for the moment. Besides, he might want to see someone other than his history professor.”
“Thanks,” replied Cassie. “When are you heading out? I need to tell him when to expect you.”
Another deluge overwhelmed Kacey’s mind.
Cassie Wagner and ‘The Kristens’ proudly present: What Did Kacey Want to Bitch About?
      The... Um... Didn’t something happen to or with the
      traffic? I don’t know. Skip and come back.
Class. I... On second thought, that didn’t really matter all that much. Next!
      My sister Delilah seemed...
  25

She quickly set her frustrations aside, replacing the grab bag of emotional discontent with a contented grin. As long as she had the Collective by her side, nothing could ever truly get to her.
“I’ll go in a bit,” Kacey finally answered. “We didn’t finish the shares yet. Theodore?”
“Thank you.” He took a sip of his Stella. “Do all yinz remember the...”

Chapter Six: Late to the Party
Dateline: The Apartment of Owen Zachney, Pittsburgh (Oakland), PA - Wednesday,
February 11th, 2032; 8:54 PM
Comments, By Caroline: I still have a few bootlegs from that show, a mere 160-
some years later.
Kacey sat on the sofa, trying desperately to process her surroundings. She found herself in The Iroquois – building two, third floor next to the stairwell, to be precise. Nearly 130 years old. Hipster before “hipster;” gentrification before “gentrification.” Home, in one time or another, to everything from a movie palace to a grocery store to doctor’s offices. Remodeled more times than worth contemplating, yet still somehow retaining the turn of the (20th) century charm that initially won the hearts of the wealthy city-wide. But to Kacey, this location was one thing and one thing only.
“You live in Laga,” she breathed softly, trying not to disturb any of the disembodied memories the tiny living space might have maintained. “This is so very, very cool.”
“Come again?” Replied Owen as he made the short journey from the pseudo- kitchen to his dinner, two glass bottles of Coke heavier.
“Club Laga. Concert venue. Me and Car...” She paused, squeezing her fists. “...Ms. Roberts and I saw They Might Be Giants and OK Go here, in this very room, in October 2001.” Another intentional silence followed. “Fine. There’s a slight possibility the stage could be your neighbor’s place. But we’re definitely on the right floor.”
Owen inverted the bottle in his right hand, using the cap to pop open the left. “This place used to be a club? Interesting. Explains the acoustics.”
“Clubs, Owen,” Kacey emphasized, grabbing the delightfully foaming beverage. “Three clubs – a rave, Laga, and some singer-songwriter coffeehouse thing – sandwiched between a dry cleaner and a closed bowling alley.”
“Knew about the alley,” He commented, sitting directly across from her. “But the clubs are new.”
She gently set her Coke on the end table next to an oddly familiar looking piece of ancient tech. “Yeah. My Insta still registers this building as several music halls, a mere 27 years after the owner shut them down.”
“Insta?” Laughed Owen. “You still use Instagram? Let me guess: You also have a have a dedicated fax line and one of those square televisions.”
“...Says the person with a rotary phone.” She smiled, gesturing to her left. “Where did you get this, by the way? Found mine in a storage locker just the other
day.”
“Belonged to my grandparents... Sort of. There’s a big ‘property of Bell of
Pennsylvania’ label stuck to the bottom.” He paused for a moment, putting a small throw pillow behind his back. “Didn’t need to make any repairs, either. The box did all the work for me.”
“What box?” Kacey asked.
27

“The one on the table beside you.”
She leaned over to see a small black box sitting next to the phone... And beneath one bottle of Coca-Cola. “Shit!” She grabbed her bottle, accidentally spilling some of the contents onto the device below. “Shit!” She wiped the mess up with her sleeve. “I’m so sorry. You should have said something!”
“I use that thing as a coaster all the time,” he explained with a grin. “Didn’t think much of it.”
“If I may get back on topic then...” She took a breath. “Does my phone need one of these box/coaster deals, or can I make do without?”
“Oh yes,” answered Owen, still sporting a jovial expression. “See, rotary phones used electrical pulses to connect to each other instead of touch tones. The conversion box makes sure the ‘newer’ switching equipment living at the phone company doesn’t get confused. I have like four in a drawer somewhere around here. You can have one if you’d like.”
“I would,” Kacey replied. “Thanks.”
“Not a problem. Let me...” He stared at the food in front of him, then looked up. “I’m so very sorry. I should wait until you leave before I start eating.”
“No... Go ahead,” she responded alongside a traditional headshake and a casual flick of her wrist. “If you wait until I stop talking, you won’t be eating until at least midnight. Besides, I should be heading back to the Three Rivers. The gang wants an in-person status report.”
“Alright, then.” He rolled up the sleeves on his blue, button-down dress shirt, revealing a few strategically placed pieces of artwork dancing up and down his
biceps.
“I like your ink,” Kacey stated, bending in to get a better look. “Is that
RoboCop?”
“Good eye,” said Owen. “I have RoboCop and The Rocketeer on my right arm;
Frodo and Decker from Blade Runner on my left. I’d like to get more, but I’m already running out of ideas.”
“Yeah,” she blurted out, mainly just to have something to say. “I thought about getting a sandworm going down the length of my arm. You know... from Dune. I have an old sketch from 1965 that I think would look amazing. Start at my shoulder and work down.”
“You’re the first Dune fan I’ve ever met in the wild,” He stated, burger in hand. “What did you think of the films they did with Josh Brolin and Dave Bautista? I fell asleep in the middle.”
“I’d rather not talk about that, thank you very much.” Kacey crossed her legs and lowered her gaze. “My mission is to get all of my friends to ignore the awful movies and read the book. So far, I’ve won over Ms. Roberts and...” She chuckled to herself. “Well... Gotta start somewhere, right?”
“That’s right.” Owen took a small bite before setting the sandwich back down on the coffee table. “Can I... Ask you a question?”
“Um... Sure,” mumbled Kacey. “Fire away.”
“Good.” He leaned forward, palms resting just above his kneecaps. “I woke up this morning and I suddenly remembered World War II. Not Saving Private Ryan or a book or a class. I mean the actual war. Like... I remember exactly where I was when I first heard about D-Day. Is that weird?”
28

She smiled, taking the opportunity to steal some fries. (Something inside of her knew he wouldn’t be bothered.) “Not at all. We all have moments like that. Jenna has the John F. Kennedy assassination, Jackie has Cyclone Tracy in 1974, multiple people have the death of John Lennon... Goes on and on.”
“What’s yours?” He inquired.
“I have multiple,” Kacey began with a smirk, “all of which are space themed. The moon landing, the Challenger explosion, the time that guy parachuted from the upper atmosphere to hock energy drinks... Every single one of them. Off-world is my specialty, for better or for worse.”
Owen began to smile again, only to hide the reaction with a well-placed napkin. “Space isn’t a bad place for your mind to reside.”
“Not at all. “Kacey leaned back. “I’m curious: How much did you know about Tara before starting the merger? I knew shit about the Kristens going in.”
“Not a lot, to be honest.” He grabbed a few fries, dredging them through the excess condiments dripping from the burger. “Outside of one chat the night before he ‘started the process,’ we corresponded through the United States Post Office. As such, I’m only familiar with the broad strokes. We’re both vegetarians. We both have an affinity for Frank Sinatra and Johnny Cash. We love the color red but absolutely loathe elephants. Both of us dress impossibly well for no good reason. That sort of thing.”
“Do you know what Tara’s two favorite movies are?” She posed, unable to hold back a grin of her own.
He shook his head. “No...”
“RoboCop and Blade Runner.”
The remains of his edible, potato-based spoon fell to the table. “You’re
making that up. You have to be.”
“Not in the slightest,” responded Kacey. “He had not seen the original Batman
with Michael Keaton but could recite every line from RoboCop III from memory. RoboCop III, Owen. That’s the bad one!”
“I wouldn’t...” He sighed. “Yeah... That one’s pretty damn terrible.”
She took a swig from her Coke. “Please, for what little is left of my sanity, say you’ve seen the 1989 Batman.”
“Is that the one with Jack Nicholson?” He asked.
“Yeah...” Kacey blurted out. “The film is a classic. One of the greatest of all time.”
Owen tilted his head to one side. “Would you be... Or go... Mad if I told you I’ve never actually seen it all the way through?”
“Oh no. Not again.” She shook her right pointer finger in the air. “You’re not going to go through another Act without knowing how to dance with the devil in the pale moonlight. So, with that in mind, I propose we have a movie night: Right here, right now. The Strand Theater will live again!”
“Sure. What the hell.” He stood slowly, stretching along the way. “But don’t you have a meeting to get back to, though?”
“I do, but that’s why the good lord invented texting,” answered Kacey. “They don’t leave till around closing time anyway. I can be a little late just this once.”
“Works for me.” Owen walked around the table, taking a seat beside her. “You do whatever. I’ll get the movie up.”
29

“Okay.” She glanced over. “I’ve been meaning to ask: Have you picked a name yet?”
“‘Tara’ to yinz; ‘Owen’ to the world at large,” he said. “That way, I don’t have to change anything.”
“Works for me.”
Kacey quickly began to craft a message, the iconic opening theme quickly filling the space around them. She made no effort to hide her smile.

To: The Three Rivers Collective
Watching the good Batman with Tara (Owen). Amazing pick. Best Tara yet. Don’t wait up.

Chapter Seven: The Party’s Over
Dateline: The Home of Kacey Wagner, New Sewickley Twp., PA - Saturday, October
16rd, 2032; 10:45 AM
Tangents, By Theodore: The Setback.
Kacey awoke to the sounds of complete and utter silence. The various pieces of salvage equipment that resided over the hill from her bedroom were inactive, as was the construction crew in the lot behind her property. No rumbling cars echoing in the distance; no commercial airliners making their collective presences felt overhead. She paid no mind to the (lack of) disturbances however, focusing instead on the monumental task of waking up on a Saturday morning.
She looked at her smartwatch to grab the time, only to be greeted by a blank screen.
Dammit... The one time I forget to charge the thing...
Kacey reached for her phone, only to find the wireless charging dock to be empty. A brief hunt ensued, ending with the pillow at the far end of her bed. She tapped the screen repeatedly. Completely unresponsive.
Two for two. Fan-fucking-tastic.
“Computer!” She barked, rubbing her eyes. “What’s the time?”
Nothing.
Did I forget to pay the electric bill? I... No. I have auto-pay. Then what...
Kasey shook her head in disgust.
Damn construction knocked out my power again. Use 311 next time! Call before
you dig, jackasses!
She stumbled out of her room and into the dining room, instantly turning her attention to the large, analog-style clock hanging on the wall. “Clock! Time!” No response. A loud, already exasperated sigh soon followed.
This day keeps on getting better and better. “Smart clock” my ass. Damn thing’s a ticking oxymoron anyway.
Upon further inspection, Kacey noticed the hands were frozen in place – 9:57:24. She stomped over to the decorative timepiece, angrily removing it from the wall. The two AA batteries in the back were for the first to go, exposing a bit of the up-to-then hidden circuit board that controlled the whole operation.
I swear I just replaced these last month. Stupid store-brand.
She pulled open the left-top drawer on the multipurpose buffet below, only to find she had forgotten to buy a fresh pack.
Of course. The one day I need them.
Small turn left, followed closely by a wide turn to the right. Galley-style kitchen, dead ahead. Another sudden shift; 45-degree angle, once again to the right. A black box no larger than a traditional egg timer sat next to the smooth glass oven, the top sporting a thin layer of dust and grease. The device officially served as a translator, making certain that each and every appliance in the immediate area, from the oven to the microwave to the coffee maker, spoke a common “language.” Kacey held down the two buttons on the side, hoping to catch a brief glimpse of the
31

time. Alas, nothing appeared on the small display. She quickly picked up the unit, noticing the standard charging cable had been knocked loose. More concerning was the fact that the watch-style battery backup, much like the AAs found in the clock, had also spontaneously failed.
Okay... That’s odd. Those never die. Still, lord knows how long this thing has been unplugged. I really need to pay more attention to this shit.
She set the box back down on the counter and swore quietly.
To the car, I suppose. No big deal. Have to feed the ducks anyway.
“Phone!” she said aloud. “Come ‘ere!” She shook her head and smiled, easily amused by her own antics. “Oh... Right. I guess I’ll go to you then.”
A brief retreat to her bedroom netted her one cell phone, a pair of yoga pants, worn sneakers and her car keys. Past the hall, through the kitchen and onto the tiny breezeway to grab her coat. She threw the front door open, slowly making her way up the flight of concrete stairs connecting the house to the driveway.
Nice day, at least. This “rain all the time” bullshit is for the birds.
Kacey found herself standing at the top of the staircase, a patch of overgrown brush the only thing separating her from the two-car garage. Out of sheer habit, she pressed the button for her ancient garage door opener. “Dumbass,” she mumbled. “That’s not going to...”
She watched in amazement at the door slowly sprung to life.
Okay... I must’ve blown a fuse.
Back down the stairs and through the breezeway Kacey ran, making a beeline to the breaker box next to the bathroom. She threw the door open, only to see... No disturbance whatsoever. Every single switch in place.
The construction had to have hit something. There’s no other explanation.
Once more out the door and up the stairs. She turned left, powerwalking past the brush and into the garage. There sat her car, the plug securely fastened to the side. A smile soon followed.
I finally remembered to plug something in! Thank you, Jesus!
Kacey pressed the “unlock” button on her key fob. No lights, no sounds, no reaction whatsoever. She tapped on the button repeatedly, hoping to see something. Anything. The only visible results were an angry car owner and several seemingly confused ducks. Pushing her charges aside for a moment, she walked over to the driver’s side door and quickly made her way inside. She rested her fingers on the “start” button and closed her eyes.
Okay, car. Don’t piss me off right now. Please start. Please...
A potent combination of swear words and duck-based chatter filled the space around her.
She put her phone on the seat and exited the vehicle. Whatever the crew over yonder did to her lines and, somehow, car would have to wait. She filled the nearest available bucket with the most mediocre feed the local Rural King farmer’s emporium had to offer and set to the task of nourishing the masses. But suddenly, in the distance...
Is... Is that a phone ringing?
The bucket fell to the ground. Fuck! That’s my phone ringing!
32

As Kacey bolted back to her house one last time, she caught a glimpse of her still glowing front porch light.
Missed that the first time. Now I’m really freaked out.
With no time to contemplate, she returned to the hallway, grabbing the hot pink corded phone hanging on the wall. “Hello?” She gasped. “Hello?”
Silence, once again.
“Motherfu-”
And yet, the ringing continued.
She ran to the front room near the kitchen. Next to an old recliner sat the
brown, rotary telephone that once belonged to Kristen #1’s grandmother and Owen’s converter box. The phone shook as it rang.
Kacey tore the handset off of the base. “Hello? Anybody? Can you hear me?”

In Their Own Words:
Where Were You the Morning of October 16th, 2032?
Transcribed by DL Sacco Some interviews edited for brevity
Theodore Tahrenna:
“Sleeping one off in Al-Stu’s basement after a particularly wild night with Tara. I didn’t know anything happened at first, to be honest. I woke up, ate a pack of Ho-Hos [snack cakes], threw my then-new repressing of ‘Yer Favourites’ by [legendary Canadian rock band] The [Tragically] Hip on the turntable and partook in a little of the Acapulco Gold I scored two days earlier. I didn’t even know anything went down until hours later, after my phone refused to start and no one came home from shopping.”
Al-Stu and Diane Antoline:
Al-Stu: “We were at the Giant Eagle [grocery store] in [the Pittsburgh suburb of] Cranberry Township. I remember the muzak stopping and the registers turning off. The lights stayed on though, as did most of the frozen food cases. [...] No one around us thought much about the outage at first. The computer networks powering the store went down all the time. We didn’t fully comprehend what had happened until we hit the parking lot.”
Diane: “We couldn’t get into our car. The ones who did [get inside] couldn’t get their engines running. The only person who got lucky – some idiot in an old Chevy pickup from the very early 80s – immediately got stuck on the four-lane. [...] A lot of people around us were convinced we were hit with an EMP [electromagnetic pulse]. I kept on thinking of that Twilight Zone episode where aliens shut off everything just to fuck with us. [Laughs]
Jackie DeNucci:
“Going into the pub after seeing [UK singer] George Ezra at [Brisbane concert venue] QPAC. We thought the power went out, so we kept on drinking. Didn’t realize anything major occurred until well into the next morning. [...] The person who really got hosed over in the whole thing was poor George Ezra himself. He ended up leaving Brizzy three months later on an English cargo boat from what I’ve heard.
Caroline Roberts:
“Taking a morning walk through my neighborhood [the Point Breeze
section of Pittsburgh]. There were two vehicles near me at the time –
34

a motorcycle and a work van for a plumber. The van looked as if they slammed on the brakes right in the middle of the street. Took [the driver and me] a good two, three minutes to get the door open. As for the cyclist... She was at the stop sign when her bike shut off. I... [Pause] A lot of day-to-day things don’t stick with me anymore. I’ve been around way too long. But that moment... One second earlier or one second later, and... [Very long pause] You know.”
Jenna McGregor and Kelly Novak:
Jenna: “Halfway through a nearly five-hour drive on the wonderful Pennsylvania Turnpike. Kelly and I spent almost two weeks in downtown Philly for my gender confirmation surgery and we were dying to get home. I needed to stop at a one of those ‘service plazas’ they used to have to clean myself up. I ran to the restroom; Kelly went to the Roy Rogers in the atrium to get breakfast. I had heard some commotion in the stall beside me, but I didn’t pay much attention. There were too many medical things going through my head at the time – don’t sit too long, don’t wipe too hard, don’t touch the incisions – for me to worry about anything else.”
Kelly: “Waiting for Jenna by the restrooms – food in one hand, phone in the other. All the sudden, I saw my screen go blank. I could hear the rest of the place swearing up a storm. None of us knew what or why at this point. Didn’t matter. Phones were off, and we were pissed. [...] A man in a Black Sabbath T-Shirt walked in about a minute later, kicking any and all inanimate objects in his way. ‘My fuckin’ piece of shit car won’t start!’ He screamed. Then another. And another. For hours on end.”
Tara Pflugh:
“Making breakfast. I had a rather ‘joyous’ time with an old friend the evening prior, all but forcing me to rise a bit later than I usually do. I had a lovely little number by Billy Eckstein playing on my vintage stereo equipment when the outage first occurred. My varied kitchen implements, not to mention all of the latest ‘gadgets’ that surrounded me at the time, instantly and irrevocably shut down. The lights above ceased function, but the lone bulb securely fastened into my oven hood kept shining. Billy kept singing.
“I somehow had the presence of mind to glance out the window. For as long as I live, I will never forget the sheer number of vehicles lining Forbes Avenue. No movement. Total confusion. I called Kacey soon after to corroborate my findings. Hers was the only landline number that I could recall at the time, for reasons that should work be glaringly obvious.”

Chapter Eight: It’s Good News Week
Dateline: Three Rivers Bar and Grill, Pittsburgh, PA - Wednesday, November 24th,
2032; 7:22 PM
Diatribes, By DL: Forty days and forty nights later...
Eight haggard faces sat around the familiar oval table.
“...Found three light bulbs in the attic the other day,” Carrie volunteered. “The funny looking energy efficient kind laced with mercury, not the good ones. Light’s terrible, but I’m not going to complain. Shitty illumination is better than no illumination at all.”
“We’ve been relying on the scented candles,” added Diane. “We can’t see shit and we live in constant fear that our house might burn down, but at least the place smells nice. Big fan of sandalwood these days.”
“Indeed!” Al-Stu rested his hands on the table. “And how are your houseguests doing, Carrie? Ours is...” He gestured over his shoulder, holding his stern reaction until the very last second. “Well, you know.”
“I’m not sticking around by choice this time,” Theodore clarified.
“Boats still exist, Theo. That’s all I’m -”
“Things are looking up I have to say,” she interrupted. “Carly got her bike
converted by my neighbor a few days ago and left soon after. I feel like Bill, on the other hand, is going to call my extra bedroom home until he dies. No one knows what the hell to do with his van, and all of the other vehicles around us won’t make the trip to Greensburg and back in one piece. All as well, though. We’re... Getting rather close, shall I say. Excellent mixologist as well.”
Tara nodded. “I shall keep him in mind, if or when attendance starts to pick up again. Any other new business?”
“The old lady down the block gave me three filament bulbs and four candles in exchange for two cans of green beans, condensed mushroom soup and a canister of crunchy onions,” commented Kelly. “Seems like a high price to pay for a half-assed casserole, but who am I to judge?”
“Exactly,” Theodore responded, flashing a small smile. “We’re doing the best we can with what we have. Besides, Thanksgiving’s tomorrow. Everyone knows sides make the meal.”
“As much as I hate to admit this, you’re right. Doesn’t make my trade any less weird, however.” Kelly leaned forward. “How have things been with you, Theo - housing aside, obviously? You know I worry about you. Always have.”
“As good as can be expected considering what’s going on.” Theodore adjusted his cap and fell backwards into the booth. “Auckland, as you’re no doubt aware, is off the table. According to the grapevine, planes are going to be down for the foreseeable future, if not permanently. No one knows what will happen once we go back up, and no one wants to try.”
“Yep,” grumbled Diane with the same generalized reaction as Al-Stu. “He isn’t going to leave until either time stops or Hell freezes over.”
36

“Going back to the South Pacific for a moment, has anyone heard from Jackie since the outage occurred?” Asked Carrie. “Hope everything’s okay.”
“Called me yesterday. She’s doing fine. I guess Brisbane was a little ‘touch and go’ there for a while, but everything has since evened out. All of that extra housing and infrastructure they built for the Olympics a few months ago came in handy. I hope we...” Theodore stopped cold, planting his elbows firmly on the table. “I see you over there smiling, Kace. Stumble upon something nice in the past few days?”
“Not really. Just a few squiggly light bulbs and an old mini-fridge the crew at the salvage yard fixed up for me. I give ‘em duck eggs, they give me a cold box I have no use for. Sounds fair. But that’s not the big news.” She paused, using the silence to build the anticipation. “I, Kacey Wagner, am now the proud owner of a brand old, still semi-working tube television! And a radio with a tape deck!”
“Damn! Jackpot!” Carrie took a sip of her lukewarm mystery brew before continuing. “Who’s broadcasting these days?”
“Depends on the format,” Kacey answered. “AM has four regulars – jazz standards, a religious guy who claims God has ‘taken our toys away,’ a pirate station playing nothing but Led Zeppelin records and some conspiracy asshole who keeps blaming trans people for the outage. The two FM stations left are also playing wall- to-wall Zep, but that’s par for the course in Pittsburgh.”
Jenna tented her fingers. “Yes... Good... ‘Operation: Inconvenience Everybody’ is going according to plan. Our overlords at the Trilateral Commission will be most pleased.” She looked around, her grin rapidly seeping through. “I’m talking about the proliferation of crappy classic rock and century-old jazz records onto the airwaves, not how the Trans World Order crippled modern tech to punish cis people.” Another pause. “I mean, I... I don’t know anything! Anyone who says otherwise is a goddamn liar!”
Kacey shook her head, trying to maintain a level of faux seriousness. “Just remember all of us have supported you from the beginning. We’re on your side.” She reached into her purse, pulling out her cold, nonfunctional phone. A few overexaggerated taps to the screen soon followed, as did an equally comedic sigh. “Dammit. Thought that would work.”
“I’ll see what I can do to hook you up again,” Jenna snickered.
“Good. As for my TV...” Kacey ran her fingers through her still greasy hair. “I get black-and-white Catholic sermons from a nun in an eyepatch, ‘round the clock coverage of the Apocalypse from the local news all-star team, reruns of I Love Lucy and a parade of pirate signal televangelists constantly reminding me how Jesus raves. He stopped selling E and got clean for our sins, you know.”
Diane nearly choked on her water.
“You okay there, Di?” Asked Kacey. “Better be. Coming back three days later as good as new isn’t in our cards anymore.”
The entire table suddenly fell silent. Heads hug low. Kelly pinched her eyes shut. Jenna eventually began to breathe heavily.
“Excuse me.” Tara barked, pounding on the table. “Now is neither the time nor the place for such self-destructive thoughts.”
“I get what you’re trying to do here, man,” Theodore began, “but we’re going to have to talk about -”
37

“No! We will only discuss our next move when it has become clear there are no other options and not one second sooner! Do you understand me?”
The entire table, save for one lone dissenter at the tail end of the booth, nodded slowly.
“Okay then.” Tara cleared his throat. “Now, I believe we were talking about Kacey’s television, correct?”
“...But we are out of options Owen,” Kacey spit out, purposefully placing particular emphasis on his legal name. “The phones won’t turn on. The servers are down for the count. Those little contact screen things that you love but always gave me a headache are dead. We’re down to celebrating mercury light bulbs and the Sharp television I swear used to live in my optometrist’s office! Don’t you see how far we all have fallen in such a short time?”
“I choose not dwell in the negativity of the moment,” he retorted. “I am certain we will build things back up to spec once again.”
“And I totally agree with you. But...” Kacey took a deep breath, in and out. Now or never. “... This whole situation really sucks. Don’t get me wrong: I think we’ll be fine in the long run as you said. We humans have got a serious ‘thing’ about moving past unthinkable bullshit. But you need to stop acting like nothing’s wrong and face what’s in front of you.”
She forced herself to make eye contact with him. “Our run as Swappers is over. Now, that doesn’t mean we all still can’t be friends or hang out every week or whatever. But this idea that we’re going to live to well into the next century, or that our grandkids and all of their friends will be immortal just like us... Those are pipe dreams, Tara.”
Tara closed his eyes. “Despite ample evidence to the contrary, we’re more than eight yinzers and an Aussie hanging out in a sports bar every other Wednesday. The Collective is our legacy. I can’t let our various achievements disappear without a fight.”
“I know, but...” Kacey’s eyes grew wide. “Oh fuck.” A pause. “Oh fuck!” She pounded her fist repeatedly on the table in excitement. “Whose handwriting sucks the least?”
“That would be me,” said Carrie.
“Great,” Kacey gasped. “We need paper, a pen and... And...”
Theodore rested his hand on her shoulder. “And what exactly are you
planning here?”
“Documentation,” she shouted. “The next generation – the ones who will
discover merging again for the first time – needs to know about us. We will live on forever. Just not in the way we first thought. Is this a good idea?”
“Absolutely.” Tara wiped his eyes. “Let’s get to work.”
38

The Five Rules of Merging
Note: The following document is presented in the most complete form available.
[...]lack of concrete information, several competing theories related to the events of October 16th have taken root in the public consciousness. The scientific community, for example, suspects the technological disruption was triggered by a “profound and seemingly irreversible” change in the atmosphere. Those with a more overtly religious nature are claiming an extreme case of “Divine intervention;” an executive decision from on high designed to calm digitized tensions down below. The last talk radio program currently standing is laying blame at the feet of the “pansexual and genderfluid global elites secretly running the United Nations.”
We do not pretend to know what exactly happened, though we tend to lean more toward scientific consensus than religious fervor or conspiratorial nonsense. We also feel, in stark contrast to our various reporter friends, that this will be more akin to an unpleasant societal setback than an all-out, world-ending apocalypse. Said one of our esteemed members just an hour prior:
“This really sucks, but I think we’ll be fine in the long run. We humans have got a serious ‘thing’ about moving past unthinkable bullshit.”
Our chief concern is with the future of the process we helped to discover. While we firmly believe merging will thrive on whatever equipment replaces servers and smartphones, we suspect none of us will live long enough to oversee the rebuilding efforts. It is for this reason we present the five principles guiding our lives’ work. We hope that by highlighting our past we can, in some small, insignificant way, inspire the future.
1. Merging your consciousness with another is an inherently spiritual act and should be treated as such.
2. Every Act, each person is to share the magic of merging with at least one outsider of their choosing.
3. Mainstream coverage of merging (newspaper articles, radio interviews, etc.) is strictly forbidden. Zero loose ends.
4. The keepsakes and mementos culled from your previous Acts – your “Collection” – are integral to your story. Keep them safe!
5. Merging is a gift. Respect that gift by making the most out of every Act.
 Sincerely,
The Three Rivers Swapper Collective 11/24/2032

Chapter Nine: Pretty Shining People
Dateline: The Home of Kacey Wagner, New Sewickley Twp., PA - Thursday,
November 24th, 2033 (Thanksgiving); 11:35 AM
Comments, By Caroline: One year later....
Note: Certain extraneous details were provided by Del Spinelli.
“You got one more to go,” Kacey told herself, staring down at the cutting board resting by the oven. “You can do this.” She wiped her hands on her apron – a smattering of blue flowers on a red canvas, inexplicably punctuated with long since dried, cream colored house paint – and brushed her hair out of her eyes. “Two minutes, tops.”
Go time. A peeled carrot laid motionless on the board. A chef’s knife took up residence in her right hand, while the Kevlar-covered left held down the fort below. Blade tilted up ever so slightly, ready to...
Two knocks on the assertive, aluminum monstrosity of a screen door rang throughout the room, easily overpowering the static-tinged hiss of the television in the front room. A sigh soon followed.
“The duck eggs are on the work bench in the garage, gang,” Kacey called out. “Take what you need. Happy Thanksgiving.”
But the rapping on the door intensified.
“Fine,” she acquiesced, her voice occupying the negative space between a respectful response and a full-blown “yell.” “You can come in. I’m going to need help stuffing zucchinis anyway.”
Rattle; click; squeak; slam.
Kacey turned to see not the owner/operators of the salvage yard beside her
property, but her sister Delilah. The knife fell to the counter.
“Surprise,” Delilah said immediately, her faded blue hair partially obscuring
the smile on her face. “Hope you don’t mind me barging in like this.”
“No! Not at all!” Kacey ran over to the small kitchen table pressed against the
back wall, pulling out a padded chair. “Sit! I’ll be right there.”
Delilah complied, taking her full-length winter’s coat off along the way.
“Is Joe with you?” Kacey asked over the sounds of her thoroughly haphazard
chopping. “He doesn’t have to wait in the car, you know. I don’t hate him...” A deliberate pause, her gaze purposefully staying on the task at hand. “...Anymore.”
“Stayed home with Emily,” Delilah replied with a small laugh. “She caught some ‘coughing’ thing at daycare three days ago. Nothing big. We don’t want to get you and your friends sick is all.” Her chair moaned against the vinyl flooring. “Hey! The Macy’s parade is back! Any good?”
“Better than you would expect, but not as good as you’d hope.” Kacey moved the bits of carrots into the center of the board, hoping to remedy her subpar knife cuts. “Been awhile.”

“Not by choice,” Delilah answered. “Most of the bridges are closed, the tunnels are still clogged and Route 51 floods at the drop of a hat. Thank god for I-
79.”
“79 is open?” She inquired, simultaneously unleashing further erratic havoc
on the hapless produce. “When did this happen?”
“Monday, I think. The stretch by here is still blocked off, though.” Delilah
sighed, the sound clashing against both the rhythm of the kitchen and the televised attempt at tradition. “Despite rumors to the contrary, I haven’t been trying to avoid you, Cassie. Really. If life were ‘normal,’ I’d be -’
“No need to apologize. I get it.” Kacey rested her blade on the obliterated chunks of produce and took two steps to her left, stopping at the refrigerator. “Takes me two hours and some to get out by the airport these days. Used to be 35, 40 minutes tops.”
“Two hours? Jesus!” Delilah pulled her nonfunctioning phone out of her pocket, setting the device gently on the table. “And for the record, I don’t know why you insist on living out in the middle of nowhere. Do you know how many rivers I had to cross to get to your place?”
“You know what mom used to say: ‘Close, but not too close.’” Kacey gave her sister an overdue hug. “I’ve missed you.”
“Same here,” she replied. “I know we go back and forth sometimes, but I never wanted to be one of ‘those’ families. You know the type of people I mean... ‘This one won’t talk to that one; both hate the third one.’ Sure, there’s the phone, but... Not the same.”
“We were semi-estranged due to a natural disaster, not clashing personalities. We’ll be fine.” Kacey pulled out the chair nearest to the television and took a well-earned seat.
“Yeah, well...” Delilah lowered her head and sighed for a second time. “What a year...”
“Seconded,” replied Kacey. “Duck eggs now haunt my nightmares.”
“I’m sorry if I’m being demanding or whatnot, but would you mind if I stole a few?” Asked Delilah, using the moment to stare at her now-useless, glass-cover slab. “Haven’t had an egg in a well over a year now.”
“Of course. Saves me the trouble of shoving them into your pocket when you aren’t looking.” Kacey paused, gesturing towards the table. “And you really have to stop with the constant glances. You’re only setting yourself up for disappointment.”
“Easier said than done, Cass.” Delilah paused, nervously readjusting her hair. “Do you realize that I don’t have any pictures of Emily? Not one. Breaks my heart just to think about that.”
“I...” Kacey shot up, fueled by an idea rattling around in her head. “You’re getting your Christmas present early. I’ll be right back.”
She ran into the front room, returning moments later with a worn, cardboard box and a filled canvas bag. “Merry Christmas, Del.”
Delilah leaned in, staring at the faded image in front of her. “That... That can’t be real.”
“This,” Kacey began with a wide grin, “is a bona fide, working Polaroid camera from 1974 with enough color film cartridges to last you at least a year. I also
41

included an old 35mm as well. Not sure of the condition. There’s some film for that thing in there as well.”
“Oh... Oh my...” Delilah gasped. ““Where did you find this?”
“Kristen #1’s storage locker,” she replied, setting the items on the table and floor, respectively. “Me, Tara and the gang at the salvage yard spent months fixing everything for you. Oh... And while we’re on the subject, don’t tell him that you know about the Kristens. He’ll get all weird.”
“Oh Cass...” Delilah immediately wrapped her sister in a tight embrace, tears flowing freely. “Thank you so, so much...”
“No problem.” Kacey said, quickly adding: “But there is just one tiny, tiny thing I want you and Joe to do for me.”
“S-Sure,” she sniffled. “Anything.”
“Good.” Kacey gently broke away in order to pick up the phone on the table. “Let go of this stylized brick, for Emily’s sake. These things aren’t ever coming back. Time to move on.”
“And how in the hell do you expect me to do that?” Retorted Delilah through the ongoing stream of emotions. “Every place I look in my house there’s something that doesn’t work anymore. Our TV is dead. The only radio that powers on is one of those stupid crank-powered things Dad gave us before he passed! We spent month upon month eating canned crap we traded for at the plaza near the house! I feel like we’re losing our minds here!”
Another thought rushed through Kacey’s already overactive headspace. She took a step back and took a small breath. “You said not but five minutes ago that Emily caught a bug at daycare. Why was she at a daycare center in the first place?”
“Went back to work last week. Both of us did.” Delilah wiped her eyes with the palms of her hands. “But -”
“And my niece...” Kacey interrupted, “...She has enough food, correct? And clean water? And isn’t freezing to death? And has all the meds she needs to get past this so-called ‘coughing thing’?”
Delilah nodded.
“Then there’s nothing to really worry about, is there?”
“I don’t...” Delilah trailed off.
Kacey slipped the phone into her pocket and returned to her chair,
prompting Delilah to do the same. “I’m not saying this whole thing doesn’t suck or that I don’t miss all of the fun stuff we used to have. But if we decide to look at what happened last October as the end of the fucking world, we’re essentially declaring defeat. And I know you, Del. You hate giving up without a fight.”
“True...” Delilah pulled her gift towards her. “So what do we do instead?”
“Go to work. Take as many pictures as that camera allows. Be positive, stay optimistic and generally try to do the best you can with what you got. Can you and Joe do that for me?”
“We’ll... We’ll try.” Delilah grabbed a napkin from the table and blew her nose. “What do you think the future will be like now?”
“No clue whatsoever,” Kacey commented, her head turning just long enough to see a shot of Santa Claus arriving in New York. “Tara’s convinced that in ten years, we’ll be surrounded by fax machines that run on radio waves and plasma TV screens.”
42

“What?!” Delilah spit out. “No way in hell do I see anyone walking around with one of those in their pockets. ‘Wait... Hold on... Have to check my fax machine
first.’”
“Better than being in a post-apocalyptic nightmare,” Kacey shot back.
“Good point.” Delilah began to stretch. “Need some help with your prep? You
mentioned earlier that filling zucchini might be a two-person job. Besides, I saw what you were doing to those carrots when I first walked in. I might not be the biggest fan of those orange bastards, but even I think they deserve better.”
“I did, and I do. But first...” Kacey rested her hand on the box. “Mind if I got a picture of my older sister first? I don’t seem to have any of those anymore.”
“Only if I can get one of you in return. Emily needs to see what her Aunt...” Delilah tilted her head. “What do you want to go by with her? You have options, you know.”
“Kacey,” she stated firmly. “Aunt Kacey.”
“Sounds good to me.” Delilah threw open the lid, slowly pulling the device out of its Styrofoam resting place. “This is pretty nice, all things considered.”
“I thought so,” said Kacey. “Just remember: This is only the beginning. Things will get better as time rolls on.”
“I know. I...” Delilah knelt on the floor, camera in hand. “Stay still, dammit! I’ve never used a camera without autocorrection before!”
Kacey smirked. “Sorry, Del.”
“On the count of three, okay? One... Two...”

Chapter Ten: Lanterns
Dateline: The Home of Kacey Wagner, New Sewickley Twp., PA - Thursday,
November 24th, 2033 (Thanksgiving); 6:35 PM Tangents, By Theodore: Darkness fades.
“...So I heard from Jackie earlier,” Theodore volunteered as he reached for the corn fritters. “She still doesn’t understand why Americans take a day off to eat but wishes us all the best anyway.”
“Jackie?” Nervously asked the lean, balding man seated at the far-left end of Kacey’s rectangular dining room table. “Do... Do I know her?”
Carrie shook her head and smiled. “No, Bill. You haven’t met her yet.”
“That’s a relief. I’m not very good with names, after all. Like...” He pointed at Diane, the sleeve of his dinner jacket quickly retracting up his arm. “...You. I want to say... ‘Dionne,’ but I know I’m wrong.”
Diane sat her fork down and shrugged. “Eh... Close enough. I think I’d be a good ‘Dionne.’”
“Hold on there, now...” Spoke up Al-Stu. “Depends on the ‘Dionne’ we’re talking about here. Are we comparing you to someone interesting and fun like Warwick or Sanders, or someone boring like the doo-wop guy who sang with The Belmonts?”
“Celine,” the rest of the table answered, followed by a round of laughter.
“I can get with that,” Diane mumbled with her mouth full. “Oh... And these peas are amazing. What did you do?”
Kacey blushed, unaccustomed to getting compliments on her cooking. “Nothing all that special. You know... Some of that olive oil we found in your basement, a bit of cashew butter made by the creepy guy at the Legion and a clove or two of Jenna’s purple stripe garlic. I simply threw everything in with some freshly boiled peas and slapped on the lid. My mom used to make ‘em like that.”
“My garlic did that?” Blurted Jenna. “Damn. What the hell am I doing wrong, then?”
“I don’t think there’s enough time left in the day for us to answer that question,” Kelly shot back happily. “Not that I’m much better, mind you. My idea of cooking is opening a box. Maybe a packet, if I’m feeling adventurous. Can’t go wrong with a little Shake ‘n Bake.”
“Yes, well...” Tara wiped his mouth, revealing a mischievous grin. “As someone who has the, ahem, ‘pleasure’ of eating many of first-Act Kelly’s meals, I fervently take issue with that last sentiment.”
Theodore nearly began to choke on his stuffed acorn squash, the giggles still squeaking through.
“You better not need medical attention, Theo,” warned Al-Stu. “Because I am not going to the emergency room tonight!”
“Me either.” Diane looked around, pointing with her fork. “Speaking of, are there any ERs even open for adults anymore? I don’t think Children’s Hospital is
44

going to accept a cumulative 80-year-old, no matter how childish he might be sometimes.”
“Depends on what you mean by ‘open,’” answered Bill. “A buddy of mine who lives near Lake Erie told me over the phone the Cleveland Clinic is accepting patients. Great facility, but at least two hours away from here.”
“Three,” muttered Jenna, fork in hand. “Most of the Turnpike is still closed. I’m guessing 80 is as well. You’d have to take Route 51 to Ohio 14.”
Theodore shook his head. “Given the choice of either choking to death or riding in an ambulance through the ass end of Ohio, I’d easily take the choking.”
“Don’t start planning your funeral yet, Theo,” Carrie interjected. “Both Allegheny General and West Penn have been up and running for months now, and Pitt’s bringing Mercy and Presby back online next week. A mad rush to the North Side or Oakland might not be anyone’s idea of a good time, but at least it’s not Cleveland.”
“Could we change the subject to something slightly more upbeat?” Kelly spoke up. “All of this talk about death and Cleveland is really bringing me down.”
“Sure. I wanted to tell you about my...” Kacey playfully smacked herself in the forehead. “The wine! I forgot to bring out the wine!”
“...Wine?” Spit out Carrie with anxious anticipation. “Like actual, real wine? Not some old bottle of Welch’s you found in the basement or something?”
“Yes,” she responded emphatically. “This is a 100% real, unopened bottle of white. Gift from the crew at the salvage yard for letting them take all of those duck eggs. Damn near broke down right there and then.”
“You got good neighbors there, Kace,” Carrie commented. “Good, weird neighbors who might be living in their scrap heap at this point.”
“Thought crossed my mind.” She pushed out from the spot at the end of table and sprung to her feet. “I’ll be right back. And stop eating! I see you, Bill!”
Kacey quickly shuffled down the thin corridor between table and the buffet, only for her ribs to collide with the back of Tara’s chair.
“Deepest apologies,” said Tara, helping her back to an upright position. “My sense of timing can be rather suspect these days. Are you alright?”
“No need for the emergency room. Al and Diane can rest easy tonight.” She took a step back, soaking in the reaction garnered by her quip. “Tara, do you and Theo mind getting out the glasses while I fetch the wine? They’re in the buffet behind yinz, to the right.”
“Of course. I -”
“Thanks! Be right back!” Kacey popped around the corner, returning a minute later, one screw-cap bottle heavier. Each of the glasses were placed perfectly on the table, right above the dinner place. She turned to see Kelly sitting on the extra chair she kept near the entrance of the doorway.
“I’ll pour,” she said, taking the bottle out of Kacey’s hands. “You sit.”
Kacey gave her a hug before returning to her general area. In the following few seconds, she narrowly avoided the backs of two more chairs and tripping on an unidentified object that Theodore had forgotten to pick up. “I swear, yinz are trying to kill me!”
“Yes...” Bill hissed after a brief moment of silence and a well-placed hand gesture. “...Trying...”
45

The entire table erupted in joyous noise.
“You found a good one, Carrie,” Diane said. “If Tara ever figures out merging again, he’ll be first on the list.” She paused. “Well, second after Tara himself.”
Theodore cleared his throat. “Fine. Third, after the Guinea pig.”
“I call dibs on number four!” Added Kacey, repositioning herself behind her chair. “I was first last time. I think ‘middle of the pack’ would be fun for once.”
Tara smiled and nodded. “That can be arranged...”
“Great. Now then...” She grabbed her glass and kneed the table, drawing every eye towards her. “I’m sorry in advance, but I got a speech in me. I promise we can continue eating right afterward.”
“Sure,” answered Kelly for the group. “The floor is literally yours.” “Fantastic.” Kacey took a long, deep breath.
“About eight months ago, while looking through Kristen #1’s old storage
locker for filament light bulbs and the like, I ran across an old Polaroid camera from the 70s. Dug some more and... What’s this? Why if it isn’t a bag of unused film cartridges! I immediately threw a pack in, ran outside and... Nothing. Damn thing’s dead. But I – and to this day have no idea how – resisted the urge to throw that piece of shit against the first wall I could find. I instead went to Tara’s place; to the scrap yard. Took the six of us most of the spring and all damn summer, but we finally got the thing working. Better than working. Near-mint condition.”
“You got a Polaroid?” Asked Jenna. “Can we see? I think a group picture’s in order.”
“Um... Not exactly.” Kacey rubbed the back of her neck with her free hand. “But there’s a story attached.”
Jenna chuckled. “Always is.”
“Now I don’t know how many of you know this, but I have a seventeen-month old niece named Emily. My sister Delilah and her husband Joe have exactly zero pictures of her now that the phones have failed. We did the rehab job for her – for them. I originally had Christmas in mind, but Del...” She wiped her eyes. “Del showed up this morning unannounced. Haven’t seen her in a year-plus. Gave her everything, right there and then.”
“Bet you made her year,” Bill snuck in.
“Decade.”
He nodded in agreement.
“Getting back on track here...” Kacey began to fidget with the wine glass,
narrowly avoiding any major mishaps. “There’s two different ways I can look at that moment. I could be as depressed as fuck right now. I mean, we used to be able to take about a million pictures whenever we damn well pleased and share them with complete strangers. These days, the mere thought of being able to document your kid’s life can bring a person to tears. That’s a long way down. I wouldn’t begrudge anyone for feeling completely hopeless right now. Lord knows I do sometimes.”
Kacey looked up and smirked.
“...But then there’s this other part of me. The part that realizes that society,
despite the prediction of every post-apocalyptic sci-fi novel ever written, didn’t collapse. We didn’t go Medieval on each other, either metaphorically or otherwise. Yes, things have been rough. There have been losses, tragedies... The whole nine.
46

But we’re still trying. Still fighting all of the despair festering in the pits of our stomachs. And those fights can manifest themselves in some truly amazing ways. Like... Did you know that they not only held, but broadcasted the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade this morning?”
“Wow!” Exclaimed Diane. “Any good?”
“I’ll tell you what I told Del: Better than you would expect, but not as good as you’d hope.”
“Better than nothing...” She retorted.
“Exactly my point. And here’s the thing: We all have personal points of lights shining on in the darkness. Take...” She pointed to her right side. “...You, Theo. Yes, it totally sucks you couldn’t do your decade-plus stint in Auckland, and that’s probably eating you up inside. But honestly? I don’t think any of us could have gotten though this without your wisdom, humor and that abnormally large stash of Acapulco Gold you hid in the Antoline’s couch cushions. You keep us grounded in reality, whether you realize that or not.”
Theodore grabbed his napkin and began to wipe his eyes.
“And Bill hasn’t been back to his hometown of Greensburg since before last October. But at the same time, he -”
Carrie took Bill’s hand gave him a kiss on the cheek. Their seven friends began to clap.
“...That is so freaking adorable.” Kacey indulged in one more big breath. “I guess what I’m trying to say is...” She tilted her head. “You know what? I think I’ve said enough. May we, as both a society and as a Collective, be able to keep our shit together for another year. I love all of yinz. Let’s continue eating. Salud!”
“Salud!”
***
Thanksgiving dinner, one year after global catastrophe.
No turkey, as the official “stars of the show” were in extremely short supply. Ducks could have been an option, but the notion of physically harming her houseguests/companions made Kacey’s skin crawl. As such, the dining party did without.
Potatoes, at least in fresh form, were unavailable in her neck of the woods. As such, they did without.
Sweet potatoes in any form had not been seen in the wild since before the global disruption. As such, they did without.
No cranberry sauce, no green beans, no cherries for pie.
But the table was full. Celery ribs filled with homemade vegan cream cheese and canned pineapple. Corn; hand-picked from the farm across the street and prepared in numerous ways. An actual pumpkin-like pie made from the closest thing to a baking pumpkin the American Legion community market had available. And, of course, bread stuffing. Stuffing bursting from every gourd they could find.
Not a traditional holiday meal by any stretch of the imagination.
But as Kacey looked at the table in front of her and the best friends surrounding it, she didn’t want anything else in the world.

Chapter Eleven: Everything Old Is New Again
Dateline: The Home of Kacey Wagner, New Sewickley Twp., PA - Thursday,
November 22th, 2040 (Thanksgiving); 11:25 AM
Comments, By Caroline: I currently own three of Kacey’s hand-built radios, all of
which live on a shelf in my office at Pitt. No one is allowed to touch them. No one. Note: Certain extraneous details were provided by Del Spinelli.
“Aunt Kacey!” Rang a bright voice from the breezeway. “Aunt Kacey! We’re here! Merry Thanksgiving!”
Kacey turned to see an energetic eight-year-old barreling towards her general direction. She rested her oversized chef’s knife on the cutting board and crotched down, waiting for what she hoped would be a warm holiday hug. The actual encounter, however, resembled less of an embrace and more of a cheerful shoulder tackle.
“And a very Happy Thanksgiving to you, Emmy,” she replied, her elbows gently making contact with the vinyl flooring below. “And where is everybody? You couldn’t have driven here by yourself.”
“Mom’s outside parking the van somewhere so she wouldn’t squash any ducks because that would be bad,” Emily explained in one extra-long breath. “Dad and Denise are at home because I got the flu from school two weeks ago which gave mom the flu which gave them the flu. I don’t have the flu anymore.”
“More Thanksgiving dinner for you, then, right?” Kacey smiled as she made her way to her feet. “Take your coat off. Stay awhile!”
“Okay, Aunt Kacey.” Emily unzipped her aging, dark blue winter jacket, revealing a pristine, Pirates-themed polo shirt underneath. The outerwear, not to mention the sparkly pink mittens and prerequisite glittery headwear that went with, soon laid on the ground below. “I really like your house because I’m always warm except when I go to bathroom then I’m cold.”
“Me too,” Kacey commented, picking up her niece’s various accessories and shoving them into the right sleeve of the coat. “So... What are you going to ask Santa for this year?”
“I... I really want one of those radios that you can take places,” she whispered, looking down. “But mom and dad said Santa is having a really hard time making those this year, so... Um... I don’t -”
The door creaked open, prompting Emily to stop mid-ramble.
“Happy Thanksgiving!” Greeted Delilah, the door slamming behind her. “You’ll be happy to know that all of your ducks are still alive and quacking.”
Emily walked over to the far side of the kitchen, next to the circuit breaker. “Hi Mom! Merry Thanksgiving! Me and Aunt Kacey were just talking about...” A small grin formed on her face. “...Stuff... And things...”
“Oh, were you now?” Inquired Delilah. “And does any of that stuff/things have to do with a jolly person in a red suit?”
“Maybe...” She said blushing.
48

“Y’Know, Emmy...” Kacey gestured at the clock hanging over the sink. “I have it on good authority that Santa will be showing up on the streets of New York any second now. I have the Macy’s parade on in the front room, if you’d like to -”
“Yes!” Emily exclaimed. “I’m comin’, Santa! Don’t start without me!”
Kacey waited for her niece to turn the corner before starting her commentary. “I understand your reservation about screens, Del. I do. But you really need to get a TV again. She’s too old to have her mind blown by ‘them movin’ pictures.’”
“Big present this year,” reassured Delilah, slipping her full-length coat onto an adjacent nail. “You have the radio, right?”
“Of course. Lovingly restored by the only most talented of Strip District barflies. Found the Canadian mini hockey sticks you were looking for as well. Brand new.” Kacey returned to the cutting board, the rounded edge gently pressing against her lower back. “I’m sorry for prying, but I got to know: When did the polo shirts start?”
“Over the summer. She said she wanted to dress like her dad. But...” Delilah brushed her bright blue bangs out of her eyes as she moved towards the sink. “You saw those gloves, right? With the glitter?”
Kacey nodded.
“Well, we tried to give them to her sister. Yeah... That’s not happening.” Delilah shook her head. “We thought we had the whole thing figured out. Take away the pink, give her the blue. But now... Now she wants pink and blue. Do things even work that way?”
“I have been around long enough to know that conventional gender norms are merely a construct,” Kacey responded. “David Bowie wore makeup, Annie Lennox wore suits. Hell, there are pictures out there of baby FDR rocking a dress. If Emmy wants to wear polo shirts with those hideous gloves, I say more power to her. Doesn’t change who she is inside. She’ll be fine.”
“I know. It’s just...” Delilah let her shoulders go slack. “The ‘boy’ stuff at the store near the house is by the entrance, but the girls are in the back by the bathrooms. Do you realize how incredibly difficult buying clothes is now? Back to school shopping felt like running a goddamn marathon!”
Kacey chuckled to herself. “If you want some advice on what to do next, tell me. I know a few experts.”
“Might take you up on that. We’ll see what happens.” She waited a beat. “And before I forget, Joe and I are mad at you.”
“Me?” Kacey spit out. “What the hell did I do?”
“You gave Emily that tape for her birthday. The one of...” She trailed off, eventually rubbing her eyes with her thumb and fore finger. “You know... That guy. The one that sang ‘American Pie.’”
“...Don Mclean?” Kacey asked slowly.
Delilah slapped her palms together and pointed. “Yes! Him! That’s all she listens to anymore. I swear... If we have to hear about the ‘Castles in the Air’ or Vincent Van Gogh one more time...”
“Just mean she has good taste,” Kacey shot back. “And how is that my fault? That’s what the universe is listening to these days.”
49

“...Which blows my mind, Cassie,” finished Delilah. “You remember what our generation grew up listening to, right? Ed Sheeran. Kendrick Lamar. Beyoncé. Talented musicians with something modern and relevant to say. Not these kids. They’ll cling to anything. Who cares if the track was recorded for their great- grandparents or talks about a social issue that hasn’t existed in decades?”
“You’re way too young to sound so damn old,” Kacey retorted, stifling a laugh. “And I should know. I’ve been 35 twice already.”
“Right...” Delilah sighed. “When did people decide to stop recording new material, anyway?”
“...When the technological disruption obliterated 95% of the music industry,” stated Kacey. “Used records and cassette tapes are pretty much all we have right now. Not that I’m complaining. I get to hear something ‘new’ without having to leave my musical comfort zone. Total win-win.”
“Name me one...” Delilah stopped mid-sentence, tilting her head slightly. “What’s this movement even called? ‘Desperation music?’”
“According to the afternoon guy on the news, reclamation,” answered Kacey.
“Fine. Whatever. Give me one ‘reclamation’ song that’s relevant to the here and now. That’s all I ask.”
“‘Flame Trees’ by Cold Chisel,” she responded. “Mid-tempo ballad about reconnecting with old friends after a bad breakup. My personal song of the year.”
“That one is pretty great...” Delilah groaned. “Do you realize how much I hate losing arguments to you? Yinz?”
“’You’,” clarified Kacey. “One person, three lifetimes.”
“That will never not be confusing.” Delilah gestured towards the cutting board. “Making Thanksgiving dinner for half of Downtown again, I see.”
“We had the big Collective get together last night at the bar,” she said, smirking. “Tara and I are dining alone tonight.”
“About goddamn time,” interjected Delilah immediately afterward. “This ‘will they; won’t they’ romantic comedy bullshit yinz have been doing is for the birds.”
Kacey shifted forward, breaking off contact with both the board and the countertop. “Don’t look too much into this, Del. Al-Stu and Diane left for her parents in Cincinnati this morning. They won’t be back till at least Sunday. Theo’s headed to Death Valley for a few weeks to do... Whatever it is he does on his off time. Carrie and Bill are planning to visit their biker friend in Canonsburg. Kelly has been roped into helping her mom cook for the universe, despite the fact that she’s the worst cook I know. Jenna’s seeing her dad for the first time since forever, Jackie is two- thirds of a world away and yinz got the plague. We’re the only two free this year.”
“Sure. And you claim to be an aeromantic...”
“I’m being serious!” snapped Kacey. “I’m simply having dinner with a friend. That’s all.”
“Okay, Cassie. You keep telling yourself that.” Delilah winked and cracked her knuckles. “So... What’s does the S.S. Friendship plan on serving tonight?”
“We’re pushing squash into strange, new directions.” Kacey paused, anticipating a negative reaction. “What?! Squash is fun, dammit!”
“Nothing says ‘fun’ like carving a zucchini,” Delilah commented sarcastically. “I’m not sure if you’re aware of this, but they have turkeys at the Giant Eagle again.
50

Cheap, too - $3.50 a pound for the frozen store brand. The ducks never have to know.”
“What?!” Kacey gasped. “God no! We’re vegetarians!”
“You wouldn’t be hurting anyone if you took a cheat day. That’s all I’m saying.”
“...Except for the turkey we’d be consuming...” Kacey countered through clenched teeth.
“Yeah, well... Ol’ Tommy isn’t feeling much these days, is he?” Delilah ran her fingers through her hair. “A Thanksgiving without fowl is a day not worth celebrating.”
“Changing the subject before I stab you with this knife over here...” Kacey pointed towards the faux-wooden stand near the small kitchen table. Two large white boxes with a few miscellaneous appendages springing forth sat on top; a mystery device slept underneath. “Did you see my new addition?”
“No...” Delilah turned and looked. “Microwave?”
“Not quite...” Kacey quickly walked over to the device and flicked the rather large switch positioned on the side. The boxes came to life within seconds, playing 102.5 WDVE in glorious mono sound. The stylings of late cabaret singer-turned- reclamation megastar Peter Allen soon filled the room.
“Oh... Radio...” She corrected. “Don’t you have like two dozen of those already?”
“Not like this. Watch.” Kacey hit another switch, activating the machine underneath. She had the official lyric sheet in her hand seconds later.
“That’s so damn cool...” Delilah intoned, shifting her position in order to get a better look.
“I know! Never thought I’d be able to get a facsimile machine before hell froze over, but...” Kacey smiled. “Let’s just say I know to get things done.”
“Sure...” Delilah took a half-step back, nearly colliding with the refrigerator. “You built this yourself, didn’t you?”
“I did,” she responded proudly. “I used some old textbook Tara had from the 1940s as a guide. They tell you everything in not-so-simple English.”
“Makes sense.” Delilah waited a beat. “Are the guts of that thing vintage as well?”
Kacey started to laugh. “Yes, but not in the way you’re thinking. The ‘radio’ consists of a leftover woofer, various ham radio parts, the deck from an old Buick we found in the scrapyard and Al-Stu’s leftover computer case. We got the amp from Theo’s storage locker. He has like eight of them or some shit. Outside of a translator here and there and a hasty paint job, the thing remains untouched. The printer came from a doctor’s office.”
Delilah shook her head. “I don’t know how you can dream up stuff like this, Cassie.”
“We all have our talents,” Kacey answered, looking down at paper slowly tumbling at her feet. “Ah... Screw it. You’re getting your Christmas present early this year. You’re cool with a radio that vomits text, right?”
“You... You built us one?” Delilah stammered, the shock lingering in her voice. “Holy shit!”
51

“I did. Unlike mine, yinz guys’ box is in stereo.” She took a step towards the hallway. “Now keep in mind these are multiplexers – audio and facsimile info provided together in one signal. Can’t get the homemade FX-only tuner kicking yet. When I do, you’ll get one of those as well. But you ain’t missing much. All they got over there right now is the traffic report and a printable Catholic mass.”
“Oh my God. I... I don’t know what to say...”
Kacey grinned. “No words needed, Del. All I want you to do is slam a door.” “What? Why?!”
“Trust me,” she reassured. “I need you walk over to the bathroom and slam
the door as hard as you can.”
Delilah nodded, traversing the length of the narrow kitchen with ease. A few
seconds to get fully into position and...
Slam!
“Goodbye, Santa!” Kacey yelled, unable to hide her grin. “I’ll make sure Emmy knows!”
Emily instantly popped her head out of the front room entrance. “What? Santa? Where?”
“My boy Kris left something for you in the guest bedroom.” Kacey turned towards Delilah. “Hey mom! Mind if a certain kid checked out the situation?”
“Not at all,” said Delilah, tears in her eyes.
“Yes! Thanks mom!” Emily blew through the edge of the kitchen and around the corner at lightning speed. “OH MY GOD!” Rang her tiny voice moments later. “THE RADIO! SANTA BROUGHT ME THE RADIO! MOM! AUNT KACEY! YOU GOTTA SEE THIS!”
“Shall we?” Asked Kacey with a flourish.
“Of course. But first...” Delilah walked over, locking her sister in a warm holiday hug. “Thank you so much for everything. I mean that.”
“My pleasure. Merry Thanksgiving, Del.” “Merry Thanksgiving, Cass.”

Chapter Twelve: I Said I Love You
Dateline: The Home of Kacey Wagner, New Sewickley Twp., PA - Thursday,
November 22th, 2040 (Thanksgiving); 6:50 PM
Diatribes, By DL: I never had the pleasure to meet Kacey. I hope this passage does
her justice.
Note: Certain extraneous details were provided by Tara and Sammi Sharpe.
Kacey dropped her butter knife, dumbfounded over what had happened not seconds before. She had uttered... Something. A word – no, words. Those words.
And yet, she had no desire to take them back. Such a move would prove to be silly, if not downright impossible in several immeasurable ways. Instead, she simply wished to understand why she would utter that phrase in the first place.
“Okay... Let’s start from the beginning,” said Kacey, trying desperately to keep her composure. “We were eating. So far so good. And then...”
“You brought up your sister and niece,” continued Tara mid-bite. “You mentioned how much the two of them enjoyed their respective radios, and how happy their reactions made you.”
“Yes! That’s right! And then... Then...” She took a sip of her water, followed by a finger snap. “Peter Allen! I told you how I heard Peter Allen on ‘DVE, which made you tell me how much Kelly secretly loves him.”
“And Jackie,” he added.
“She’s Australian. Doesn’t count. Not liking at least one Peter Allen song is a capital offense down there.” A loud rumbling began to fill the immediate area, the end result of Kacey’s leg continually smacking off of the bottom of the table. “That’s how we started talking about music, I think.”
Tara nodded. “You proclaimed your love for that detestable ‘Flame Trees’ song for at least the hundredth time but redeemed yourself by mentioning your admiration for the legendary Perry Como.”
“I said that Carrie and Bill’s friend lives near his childhood home in Canonsburg,” she corrected. “I personally find him dull as shit.”
This commentary, no matter how it might have gone down, led me to discussing...” He tapped his fork against his plate. “...Frank Sinatra. Specifically my beloved Swing Easy! – his second release for Capitol, I believe.”
“...And the first arranged by The Riddler,” Kacey finished in record time. “Nelson Riddle,” Tara chuckled. “Completely different entity. Nelson -” “Doesn’t matter. I’ve heard this once today. Stay focused.” She took a few
deep breaths, hoping to center herself. “Anyway, this ramble coaxed you into telling me about how you had the chance to buy the expanded 1961 twelve-inch on release day but didn’t because you’re both dumb and stupid.”
“More or less,” he answered. “You followed my tale of regret up by saying we should perhaps hunt the release down. I suggested New York, you suggested downtown Cleveland for some odd reason. We laughed, which somehow prompted you to -”
53

“There we go,” Kacey interrupted, clapping for emphasis. “So... What do we do about this? Do you even feel the same way? Do I?”
Tara leaned forward, his bare elbows avoiding contact with the table. “I think you’re focusing on the wrong thing here. The question isn’t if we do or don’t feel a certain way, but rather if those feelings matter in the first place.”
“Okay...” She stared down at her plate, pretending to focus on a rogue pile of stuffing seated to the left. “I have no idea what any of that means.”
“Do you know the history between Kelly and I?” Asked Tara. “I don’t remember if the Kristens were privy to this information or not.”
Kacey shook her head. “Not really. One day yinz were together, and the next you weren’t. The end.”
“That’s right.” He took a few breaths, each louder than the last, before pushing forward. “My second Act – the original ‘Tara’ – had a rather complex romantic entanglement with Kelly’s first. We convinced ourselves that we would be together, in one form or another, forever. Alex and Diane made/make things work. Why couldn’t we?”
“Theodore is the glue that holds them together,” she deadpanned. “Without him sleeping on their couch, eating their snack cakes and pulling Acapulco Gold out of thin air, they’d be ‘splitsville’ by now.”
Tara’s sudden laugh filled the room.
“Remember to tell them that at the next meeting. I want to see how they’ll react.” He took a sip of water, the aftershocks coming on strong. “Where did I stop? My train of thought has long left the station.”
“Together forever,” Kacey replied.
“Right, right. Please indulge me for one brief moment. I need to catch up with myself.”
“Of course.” Kacey reached for the potatoes, if for no other reason than to give herself something to do. Two small servings came and went, until -
“A funny thing happened when we finally merged,” Tara stated abruptly. “A... Shift in perspective, for lack of a better description. Small, but...”
Tara let forth a loud, discontented sigh. “Her feelings for me stayed strong and unsinkable; my desire for her did not. I suddenly saw this person I had been living with for at least a decade, the woman I would have married if we were allowed to do so, as nothing more than a close platonic friend. Telling her about my change in heart was difficult to say the least, but I think she understood. I still consider her my best friend to this very day.”
“Damn, that sucks,” Kacey responded.
“In ways you will you hopefully never have to comprehend.” He shook his head. “I cannot, and will not, go through such an experience again.”
“But all of that is tied to the Swapper lifestyle,” she countered, wiping her mouth with her wrist. “The whole process is dead thanks to the disruption. We have to move on.” She tilted her head, studying his reaction. “...And you disagree completely, don’t you?”
“I must believe, for my own sake, that our current situation is no more than a temporary inconvenience. We will find the workaround we’re seeking. And when we do...” Tara leaned back in his chair. “The last thing I want is for our next Acts,
54

properly aged and seasoned, to look back at this moment and loathe us for the silly, overly simplistic decision we made.”
“‘Aged and seasoned?’” Kacey shot back. “We’re people, Tara. Not steaks. And you can’t use one bad experience from the early days as the basis for your worldview. We know what’s coming now. We can enjoy each other’s company while planning for what might happen next.”
Tara looked down, avoiding any and all eye contact. “An Act, despite what Theodore might have our group believe, is solely designed to be a learning experience. Each moment prepares us for what is coming next. And I have learned in the most painful way imaginable that nothing good comes from indulging in the ways of romance.”
“But -”
“Now, that is not to say that I don’t reciprocate the feeling on some level. Quite the opposite, I assure you. However, following those three words down the proverbial rabbit hole is a proven recipe for disaster.” He paused. “I apologize if I’ve made your momentary crisis of conscience worse.”
“I had a minor panic attack because I said something rash to the guy I like. You... You’re in the middle of a decades-long existential crisis over the very concept of affection. Makes my issues feel small.” She rubbed her shoulder out of dread. “Does this mean we’re broken up?”
“Yes, unfortunately.”
“Alright then.” Kacey forced herself out of her chair. “Before we make this breakup official, there’s one thing I want to do first. You mind?”
“Go on,” he responded, slowly making his way to his feet.
“Fantastic.”
She leaned in for a kiss. Long. Slow. Everything Kacey had ever wanted
compressed into one physical, semi-spontaneous action. In those scant seconds, she knew. She knew her words were not only warranted but were the only things that could’ve been uttered in that instance. She knew he was the person she had been searching for. But most importantly, she knew she would have to fight for what she wanted. And that she, against all odds and a mountain of so-called ‘Swapper logic,’ would ultimately prevail.
He stared at her as she pulled away. “Oh... Oh my.”
“This isn’t over between us,” she warned him. “Not by a long shot. You’re going to see just how wrong you are.”
“I highly doubt that,” Tara said, adding: “...But I’d like to see you try.” “You will.” Kacey smiled as she returned to her chair.

Chapter Thirteen: Who Listens to the Radio?
In Their Own Words: Theodore Tahrenna, On “Glue”
“I’ve called a lot of places ‘home’ in my time. More than I care to admit right now due to the whole ‘I’m an old bastard’ thing. And the one thing I’ve learned is that society is held together by glue. Don’t laugh! I’m serious! Societal glue – that one thing keeping all of this otherwise random bullshit together. For example: ‘We don’t have... What’s that, you say? You hate the President? Guess what? I hate the President too! Let’s get together and talk about how utterly terrible they are!’ Doesn’t have to be politics, either. Could be religion, sports, movies... Whatever. I think I got my point across.
“Now here’s a terrifying line of thinking: What happens to a society that runs out of glue? Falls apart, right? I’m talking complete and total collapse here, not a glorified argument that gives an entire culture a philosophical headache. Hasn’t happened in my lifetime, but we’ve come close – like ‘cutting the tube open and scraping the insides out with your finger’ close. Historians like to call this period of time The Setback.
“Sounds super dramatic, I know. But things were... [Pause] People these days don’t understand what the word ‘nothing’ means. They think ‘destitute.’ And they couldn’t be more wrong. We had homes, electricity, food after a hot minute... All that good stuff. What we lacked was the societal glue; the one thing (aside from the unprecedented natural disaster, obviously) that made us come together. Politics... [Pause] We had to have the 2032 presidential elections in 2034. All of the professional sports leagues closed up shop for years on end. No fancy technology to kill the time with. No TVs either, as most of the working sets were based on said ‘fancy technology.’ Media production went dead, as did anything that even remotely connected to the words ‘digital distribution.’ We were convinced that we were officially out of glue. That, right there, is what ‘nothing’ meant to us.
“Okay... Fine. We did have two things to keep us sane: Old books and old music. We collectively hit the libraries, clearing the shelves in seconds. But even then, that didn’t help the discourse in the long run. Yes, we were entertained, but the social aspect of discussing a written work didn’t exist. I mean, the chances of your neighbors having the same copy of... Off the top of my head here... Windows 95 for Dummies that you did were slim to none. That left music. Record shops and thrift stores and basements full of vinyl and tapes. We devoured everything we could get our hands on. Age, genre, length... Didn’t matter. ‘New to us’ meant ‘new, period.’
56

“So, how did we share our new finds? Our ‘reclaimed classics,’ if you will? Radios, of course. The tuners we found shoved into our salvaged turntables or the decks we took out of cars in the junkyard. DJs brought in their favorite finds and just started playing. Then, they made cassette copies for other DJs in other towns. Soon, an endless stream of ‘new to us’ music filled the airwaves. We had something shared to discuss once again.
“And that’s why I think these [eight upcoming] vignettes mean so damn much. They show how our music, these random songs we found in a crate somewhere, brought us together. Kept us sane. They were, and for the few left who either lived through that era or knew someone who did, still are, our societal glue.”

Part One: Theodore Tahrenna
Dateline: The Home of Kacey Wagner, New Sewickley Twp., PA - Saturday, January 12th, 2041 (Thanksgiving); 3:25 PM
#1 on the Pittsburgh Reclamation Charts: “Lost Weekend” by The Beat Farmers Original Release Date: May 1985
Weeks at #1: Three
“...But if you do happen to find one in your -” Kacey paused, intently focusing on the sudden silence overtaking the other end of the line. “Hello? Hello?”
“Son of a bitch!” she yelled, slamming the vintage brown handset back onto the base. “Goddamn asshole... At least let me finish my sentence first!”
“People these days,” observed a voice coming from behind. “I tell you what...”
Kacey turned, instinctively reaching for the not quite legal .45 she kept hidden in the folds of her recliner. But instead of encountering an intruder, she found herself staring at a tanner, thinner version of Theodore.
“Hey there, Rambo, Miss me?”
“JESUS CHRIST! DON’T SCARE ME LIKE THAT!” She tucked the partially visible weapon back into the cotton void, eyes still wide. “You know my chair is loaded!”
“And you know how fond I am of making an entrance,” he replied with a calming smile. “Come on, Kace. If you aren’t startled, then I’m not trying hard enough.”
“You’re crazy, you know that?” Kacey stood, immediately locking her old friend in a tight embrace. “Glad you’re back and lead-free, Theo. Hope your ‘lost weekend’ in Death Valley went well for you.”
“Picked up a few shifts at the one diner out there, made a few new friends... the usual.” Theodore pulled away slowly, taking a half-step back. “Something about that whole area... really resets the soul, you know?”
“Nope,” she answered instantaneously. “I want to stay as far away from ‘death’ for as long as possible.”
“Fair enough.” He pushed the few rebellious strands of hair back under his wool knit cap, never once breaking eye contact. “And that’s an interesting choice of words back there. I’m guessing Country Dick Montana and the boys finally made their way out East.”
“‘Lost Weekend’ has been playing nonstop since Christmas,” Kacey said as she made her way to her favorite kitchen chair. “If I didn’t know better, I’d say they were singing about you.”
“Yeah, well...” Theodore trailed off with a smirk. “I’d like to think I’m not that bad.”
“You can think whatever the hell you like,” she shot back, sporting a smirk of her own. “You knew him, right? That ‘Country Dick’ guy you just mentioned?”
He shook his head. “Wrong rock star. Mine’s from Canada. I did see The Beat Farmers up in Toronto about a week before he died, though. Amazing show.”
“Close enough for my taste.” Kacey leaned back, crossing her ankles. “Plan on moving anywhere fun in the next few months?”
 58

Theodore reached into the cupboard, pulling out an opaque glass from the top shelf. “Stuck here for the long haul, I’m afraid. Traveling like I used to is nigh impossible these days.”
“Don’t act like hanging around Western Pennsylvania is a death sentence,” she countered. “I mean... It is. Completely and totally. I’m just saying that you shouldn’t act that way. Brings down the morale of everyone else stuck here with you.”
“Right.” He took a moment to fetch some ice from the bottom freezer – three cubes, as always – and some water from the sink. “There’s a good chance we might not even be in Pennsylvania next year if the rumors are true.”
“Finally seceding from the Union?” Kacey asked, trying (and failing) to keep a straight face. “About damn time, I say. Canada would be lucky to have us. Screw Philly!”
“You’re closer to the truth than you think.” Theodore responded, a pronounced, water assisted “gulp” punctuating the middle of the sentence. “I heard from a friend of a friend at the campsite that the Western counties want more control over the shipping lanes. A divorce seems imminent, according to her.”
“Delivering shit via boat has made a major comeback as of late. Never seen the Ohio this full.” She pushed a nearby chair out with her foot. “You can sit, you know.”
He raised his hand and shook his head. “No, thanks. I’ve been sitting way too much today. Standing’s better for you, anyway.”
“Offer’s open.” Kacey waited a beat. “In all seriousness, what would happen if we decided to leave the Commonwealth? Hitch a ride with Ohio? West Virginia, maybe?”
“Your guess is as good as mine. Personally, I’d like to see us do our own thing. We’ve been dealing with the East’s bullshit for way too long. Get us the ‘Westsylvania’ Ben Franklin always wanted.”
“...Because nothing says ‘progressive’ like pleasing the corpse of Ben Franklin.” She straightened herself in her chair, unconsciously pulling her shirt down at the ends. “As interested as I am, I’m taking this whole thing with a mine’s worth of salt. No offense, but I want a source slightly more official than a half dozen hippies hanging out in the middle of the desert.”
“Fair enough.” He took another sip, almost choking in the process. “Oh! I asked my new friends about the wild, vinyl goose you’re chasing.”
“Duck, Theo. Wild vinyl duck.” Kacey leaned forward. “So? What did they
say?”
“That you’re wasting your time. Anything released before the late-60s is
pretty much impossible to find these days.”
“Seems to be the consensus,” she sighed. “I’ve been hung up on so many
damn times in the past month and a half that I’ve lost count. Still not giving up, though.”
“Of course you won’t. Not in your nature.” He took a step towards the refrigerator. “I’ve known Tara for way too many years now. If you think this one gesture is going to ‘win him back’ or something, you’ve got another thing coming. He doesn’t work that way.”
59

“I’m not a loved-starved five-year-old,” spit out Kacey, doing whatever she could to not raise her voice. “I’m way past any feelings I might have had for him. Way past. This whole thing is nothing but me trying to do something for a friend. I’d do the same for you if you didn’t have one of everything ever made.”
Theodore pushed himself backwards, ultimately resting his head against the top of the freezer. “My Collection is pretty tight these days...”
“Best in town by a country mile,” she confirmed. “Mine is full of non- functioning tech and area rugs from Kristen #2’s grandparents. Those people sure did love their slippy carpets.”
“Nice people, your grandparents. Loopy as fuck and stubborn as shit, but a lovely couple all the same.” He pulled his legs into his chest and closed his eyes. “For the record, I think Tara was being an overthinking jackass at Thanksgiving and lost something truly special in the process. Swapping and merging are in the rear view. Enjoy whatever time you got left, I say.”
“Of course you’d say that.” Kacey shifted in her chair and looked down. “But thanks for the vote of confidence. Means a lot.”
“No problem,” Theodore let the words hang in the air for longer than Kacey thought necessary. “Jesus... Talking shouldn’t be this hard!”
“What, you going to propose or something?” she asked, deriving particular enjoyment by his horrified facial expression. “Not a hard thing to do, Theo. Simply look me deep into the eyes and say ‘Kacey, I love you forever. Let’s run away together and adopt one kid for each day of the week.’”
“No! I mean, yes! I mean...” He took a deep breath. “I guess what I’m trying to say is that dating you would be like dating my sister or Al-Stu or Al-Stu’s sister.”
“Oh, I know. I’m merely a fan of you freaking the fuck out for no good reason, that’s all.” Kacey leaned forward. “Now then, what were you really going to talk to me about?”
“You okay?” Theodore asked, using a gentler tone than Kasey was accustomed to. “According to Jenna, the group hasn’t seen you since Christmas, which is weird as hell for you. And let’s not forget the fact you did consider pulling a gun on me.”
“‘Consider’ is the key word in there.” She shook her head. “But to answer your question, I’m alright. Between the ducks and my repair work at the scrapyard, I don’t have time for much else.”
“Uh-huh. You’re trying to avoid Tara, aren’t you?”
“What? How dare you imply -”
He threw hands in the air, palms facing forward. “Okay. You’re right. That’s
none of my business. So instead, allow me to make an offer to you. Would that be alright?”
Kacey nodded.
“Great. Now then: I plan on going up to Canada sometime in early February to visit a few people from back in the day. You want to come? Better than sitting here more or less alone.”
“I...” She stopped mid-sentence, a wide variety of thoughts filling her mind. Canada would be an interesting change of pace - a different land with a slightly different culture and profoundly different set of ducks. An entire country where she could escape; get away from certain facets of her life that had been wearing thin as
60

of late. And what was stopping her? She had the time, the money, the passport. She knew exactly what to do.
“Hmm...” A smile graced her lips. “Sure. What the hell. I’m up for an old- fashioned misadventure or six. Besides, this’ll give me a whole host of new retailers to get disappointed by. Get ready to hang up on Kacey, Ontario!”
Theodore buried his face into his hands.
“I’m joking,” Kacey reassured him, doing everything within her power to sell him on her impromptu lie.
“I don’t believe you for a second. But at least you’re getting out of the house. To lost weekends with a good friend.”
“To lost weekends.”

Part Two: Jenna McGregor
Dateline: Pittsburgh National Railway Station (Pittsburgh National), Moon Twp., PA - Friday, March 16th, 2041; 11:40 AM
#1 on the Pittsburgh Reclamation Charts: “Fit but You Know It” by The Streets Original Release Date: April 26th, 2004
Weeks at #1 (Total): Seventeen
Kacey smiled as she approached the dark blue, salt-covered Toyota Camry situated in the back-left corner of the hourly lot. She knew the vehicle better than anyone in their close circle of friends. The first person outside of Jenna herself to be allowed inside. The only non-family member with their very own key. And after the technological disruption, the only person talented enough to pull off a prized digital- to-analog conversion. Jenna had other modes of transportation – new, nicer, cleaner. But this... this held a special place in their hearts. A one-of-a-kind memory driven both with and for a purpose.
The driver’s side door swung open, music blasting from seemingly every which way. Jenna emerged soon after, wearing the worn, dark red Christmas present Kacey had bought – stole? – from a Goodwill drop-off bin eight years prior. No words emanated from the temporary chauffer. Simply a smile and a hug.
“I don’t care what the rest say,” Kacey began, not wholly willing to let go, “but you still look fantastic in that jacket. ‘Repurposed red’ is definitely your color.”
Jenna nodded, stepping away several seconds later to fetch the slush-kissed suitcases laying near the back tire. Kacey went in the opposite direction, both meeting at the propped-open trunk. Four bags in the back, followed by a thoroughly old-fashioned (and highly unnecessary) forceful slam for good measure. Everything seemed, on the surface at least, to be as she remembered. But something felt... different about Jenna. “Off,” for a lack of better descriptor. An intangible feeling of mystery fell over her; a sensation she wasted no time in exploring.
“Hey,” Kacey said, pulling open the passenger’s side door. “You alright, honey? Never seen you this quiet before. Or ever, if I’m being totally honest here.”
The question was greeted with silence, at least at first. Kacey slipped in and buckled her belt, the knot forming in her stomach growing ever bigger. But suddenly and without proper warning...
“I’ve never been better, Kace. Why do you ask?”
“Your... your voice!” Kacey spit out, not giving herself any time to think her statements through. “It’s... it’s... oh God... help me say something nice that won’t completely offend you! And how the fuck are my ducks?”
“The ducks are good and so are you,” Jenna responded through bouts of laughter. “The key, for me at least, is to avoid my diaphragm and to stop hating myself for slipping up. I keep on doing that and... Let’s just say the days of sounding like a bassist from a doo-wop group are officially over.”
“You don’t have to conform, you know. You could...” Kacey froze, squeezing her fist in frustration. “...not yell at me for cis-splaining gender to you.”
“On the contrary...” Jenna threw the car into park and took her hands off the wheel. “Say your peace. I want to hear your take.”
 62

“There’s nothing wrong with being genderqueer or nonbinary or...” sighing, “...’genderfree.’ You want to have a deep voice? Have one. I love your original sound. And also...” She rubbed her eyes with her fingers and unleashed her second sigh in twenty seconds. “Can I state for the record that using the term ‘genderfree’ in a positive context makes me extremely uncomfortable? I feel like Graham Linehan and the old-school ‘gender critical dumb shit’ crowd is dictating inclusive language again.”
“I know. But the new generation... they don’t remember all of that Twitter nonsense, thank whoever you want to thank. I’m certainly not going to dredge all of that back up. Let them identify whichever way they want to.”
Kacey nodded.
“As for my voice, I made the change because I wanted to. I’m not an enby, as our current generation used to say. I’m a woman – a good, old-fashioned, ‘lovin’ the binary’ female who simply wanted a better ‘sound.’ If I may paraphrase a certain sudden local celebrity, I’m fit, and I know it.”
Once again unsure as to what could or could not be said, Kacey simply gave her friend a noncommittal thumbs up.
“Stop being weird, Kace. I’m not mad. Nothing you can ever say will bother me. Honest to God.” Jenna paused, taking the time to back the car out of the space. “At least acknowledge my amazing musical reference!”
“...Which I don’t get, as I’ve been in Canada for the last month and some,” replied Kacey. “Nothing but Boys Brigade, Kick Axe and Steven Page playing up there these days.”
“I’m not familiar any of those people,” Jenna retorted. “All I know is that you can’t go wrong with something called ‘Kick Axe.’”
Kacey leaned back, turning her attention to the barren, late-winter landscape lurking just outside of the car window. “Oh yes you can. If I have to hear one more hair metal anthem about the joys of rockin’ out, I’m going to scream.”
“Ick,” Jenna commented, her “new” voice cracking against her will. “I hated the 80s first time around. I have no desire in reliving them.”
“Same here. But...” Kacey trailed off, waiting a beat before continuing. “Up for a story?”
Jenna stayed silent, which Kacey interpreted as an affirmative nod.
“Okay then.” She cleared her throat. “Theo and I, being the supreme dumbasses we are, decided to take an impromptu trip from Toronto to Moncton, New Brunswick. In a rental car. In Canada. In February. We barely got to Kingston – that’s where his friend the rock star grew up – before the snow did us in. We were sitting off the side of the Ontario 401 freezing our asses off, when this old sounding French song came on. Didn’t know what the hell they were saying, but goddamn if the thing wasn’t catchy as hell. We ended up hearing the track at least a half dozen times before the squall let up. The melody is still stuck in my head.”
“And what’s the name of this mystery classic?” Inquired Jenna.
“‘J’entends frapper’ by Michel Pagliaro. So very, very awesome. So very, very French.” Kacey gestured toward the back of the car. “I have like a dozen 45s in my big suitcase if you want one. And by the way, you do indeed want one.”
63

“Of course. Excuse me for a moment, dear.” Jenna reached over to what used to be the glovebox, twisting on a repurposed dimmer switch that now controlled the heater. “Find the special thing you were looking for?”
“No...” muttered Kacey. “Most people I talked to looked at me like I was crazy. But I’m not giving up, though. Can’t.”
“Get that white whale, Ahab.”
“Plan to, Ishmael.” Kacey smiled, letting the unnatural rhythms of the highway briefly take over. On the drive went, until an ill-timed pothole forcefully slammed her back into reality. “Whoa... I’m awake,” she commented to no one in particular. “Um... Jenna? Are you going to tell me about what you were referencing, or should I start building a narrative in my head?”
“Right! The song! One second!” Jenna hit rewind on the car’s tape deck – the very deck designed and rebuilt by Kacey herself.
Whir... Click!
Soon after a guitar riff, the same riff that had greeted her not twenty minutes before, began to play. “Ever hear this?”
“Nope,” Kacey said, shaking her head. “Judging by the slang and the accent of the... singer? Rapper? Slam poet? I’m guessing this is from the UK.”
“Yeah,” Jenna responded, rewinding the tape to the beginning. “‘This is ‘Fit but You Know It’ by The Streets – 2004, I think. Biggest song in town right now. You up for something new?”
“Eh... what the hell. I’ll try anything once.” She closed her eyes, letting the song at hand – not to mention Jenna’s live backup vocals - wash over her.
“So...” Jenna began as the outro played, “what do you think?”
“Wow! Amazing stuff. Really is.” Kacey took a deep breath, centering her thoughts. “But did anyone in town pay attention to the lyrics before falling in love? The main character is a misogynistic asshole who belittles a woman for not sleeping with him. Is that who we want to be?”
“In all fairness, Mike is supposed to be unlikeable,” Jenna commented. “And no, we didn’t. The entire city is taking the phrase as a positive affirmation.”
“Sounds about right.” Kacey sunk in her chair, eyes still pressed shut. “Where did yinz find this? Radio station backroom? Corner bin?”
“Some gym on the South Side used the chorus in their radio ad. Took about a week and a half for the song to go from ‘commercial’ to ‘mega-smash.’ My buddy Corey...” Jenna paused mid-sentence, her go-to move when dropping a celebrity name. “... I mean, Mayor O’Connor even invited front man Mike Skinner to perform live at the Penguins game. First sellout they had since the league started back up.”
“Sellout? For this guy? Damn!” Kacey opened her eyes and turned her head. “Is it bad that I really want to see him live now?”
“Not at all,” answered Jenna. “Luckily for you, the Collective has third row tickets for his show at the Zambelli Arena in May. Everyone who’s still in town is coming – even Tara. I have one for you if -”
“Yes!” Kacey blurted out, smashing the rewind button. “Thanks!”
“No problem,” she stated, reaching for the knob once again. “Glad to have you back home, Kace. Things weren’t the same without you.”
About that...” Kacey rested her feet on the dashboard and smiled. “I had a major realization the other day.”
64

“Oh?” Asked Jenna rhetorically. “Care to clue me in?”
“Sure. Why not?” Kacey took an overly loud, knowingly dramatic deep breath. “There’s this part of me - a big, loud, awful part I hate with a passion - that’s convinced I’m an introverted shut-in destined to die alone. The cops will find my corpse three weeks later hunched over a cassette deck or something.”
“I know that voice. It can completely fuck off.”
“YES!” yelled Kacey, her enthusiasm temporarily getting better of her. “I got friends who love me. They take me on vacation when I’m feeling shitty. They buy me concert tickets out of the goodness of their hearts. They choose not to outright murder my ducks. I have two nieces who, despite the fact I’m usually terrible with kids, adore me. And let’s not forget your new voice, which I love and am already super jealous of. I’m being serious, by the way.”
Doesn’t fit your overarching point,” Jenna began, “but I can’t say ‘no’ to a good compliment.”
“As well you shouldn’t.” She chuckled to herself. “But yeah... I’m healthy, happy and, thanks to the wonder people around me, generally don’t have a complaint in the world. I guess you can say, no matter what I might hear in my down moments, that I’m fit.”
“...But you know it,” finished Jenna. “Damn right I do.”

Part Three: Alex (Al-Stu) and Diane Antoline
Dateline: The Home of Kacey Wagner (Driveway), New Sewickley Twp., PA - Friday, May 3rd, 2041; 5:30 PM
#1 on the Pittsburgh Reclamation Charts (Starting the Next Week): “Toe Jam” by The Brighton Port Authority (BPA) featuring David Byrne and Dizzee Rascal Original Release Date: August 5th, 2008
Weeks at #1: One
Kacey stood proudly in her driveway; a singular voice of authority in a short, hooded trench coat and matching leggings. She glared at her congregation, arms behind her back. “Good. You’re all here. I’ll make this quick.”
One step forward. Maintain her position within the group. “I’ll be back in a few hours, gang. Be good, okay? That includes you, Quackers. Keep it in your pants for once.”
Her loyal subjects quacked and honked in what she chose to believe was delight.
“Good. Now go. We need to get through here.”
But the ducks stayed still.
“Go! Go! I... Goddammit.” She turned to the vehicle lurking in the background,
making a turning motion with her right hand. “Okay, Al-Stu,” she yelled. “Start the car!”
The engine sprang to life seconds later, all but forcing the gaggle of ducks to scatter. All, that is, save for one – a male Muscovy with white plumage and an oversized frame. There he sat, unwilling to give an inch.
“Move, Big Boy,” Kacey commanded politely. “You don’t want to meet the front of the car. Won’t end well for you.”
But Big Boy refused to budge.
“Oh... I know what you want.” Kacey leaned down, the spaghetti strap purse slipping off of her shoulder and onto her elbow, and gently scratched the back of his neck. “There. Is that better?”
Big Boy honked, casually making his way to the garage.
“Fucking emotionally needy duck,” Kacey mumbled softly to herself. “I spoil you, you know.”
In the middle of the driveway, after the main entrance but before the enclosed loop, sat a restored, coral flame red 1950 Ford. The occupants, Al-Stu and Diane, respectively, had rebuilt the classic by hand in a previous Act. Once a display piece designed for the dozens of local “hot rod nights” that dotted the Western Pennsylvania area, the technological disaster forced the machine back into active duty.
Kacey, with the assistance of her friends/neighbors/part-time bosses at the scrapyard, retrofitted the vehicle with a few “modern” touches. The radio, for example, now featured both a tape deck and a hand-built turntable designed for 45s. The old engine had been put into storage, replaced with an equivalent diesel modified to run on biofuel (otherwise known as used cooking oil). Shoulder seat
 66

belts, once unheard of, were hastily added to the back seat. She took a deep breath, filling her lungs with the smell of fresh French fries, and made the short trek over.
“Picking you up is always such a production,” Diane commented as Kacey climbed behind the seat. “Ducks, ice in the winter, the former owner deciding that loose bricks made for a good gravel substitute... full-on nightmare fuel.”
Kacey chuckled. “Still not as bad as going anywhere with Theodore, though. Do you realize how many times we almost missed our trains because he couldn’t wake up or get out of the bathroom?”
“Not a fair comparison,” Al-Stu quickly interjected. “No one takes as long to get ready as Theo. No one. How yinz were able to traverse Eastern Canada and get to your destination on time is a mystery to me.”
“Simple: we didn’t.” She set her purse on the seat beside her, the song of the moment weaving its way through the roar of the classic automobile. “Is this...” she tilted her head, “yes! David Byrne! Talking Heads deep cut or one of his solo tracks no one ever gave a shit about?”
“Kind of the latter but not really,” answered Al-Stu. “Remember Fatboy Slim? The ‘Praise You’ guy? This is his side project, The Brighton Port Authority. According to Bill and Sean on ‘DVE, they recorded one album before breaking up. This is their lead single and by default best known song, ‘Toe Jam.’”
“Cool. And what the -” Kacey’s froze, momentarily transfixed by the sudden vocal and lyrical shift. “Never thought I would say this, but the rap break really ties Byrne’s cryptic bullshit together. Who the hell is this, anyway? The rapper, I mean.”
“UK hip-hop legend Dizzee Rascal,” Diane chimed in. “He’s the opener for Mike Skinner and The Streets tonight. They were out in Market Square yesterday handing out 45s and cassettes to anyone willing to talk with them. That’s where we got our copy.”
“For free? That doesn’t make any sense, though. At least save some of them for the merch booth.”
“On the contrary...” Diane turned, her right arm resting against the top of the seat. “Have you ever heard of Northern soul?”
Kacey shook her head.
“Way back in the 1960s, a bunch of hipster kids in the north of England suddenly became obsessed with obscure American soul records that didn’t sell. Every Saturday night, they would pack clubs in Wigan and Blackpool just to listen to their favorite songs. And when I say ‘obscure,’ I mean basically nonexistent. Some of the singles had a print run of three copies, maybe four tops.”
“But I thought they didn’t like the Four Tops,” Al-Stu observed. “Too commercial.”
“We’re going to ignore you now, honey. Anyway...” she sighed, “most of the singers ‘involved’ with the movement didn’t know about any of this. How could they? Their labels went under as soon as their careers did. The ones who did get wise only found out decades later, long after the scene petered out. Do you know what they did heard the news?”
“Not even registering a guess,” Kacey replied with a shrug.
“They cried in joy. Every one of them. Those artists, just like Mike and Dizzee yesterday, didn’t give a shit about fame or money anymore. They simply wanted
67

people to appreciate their lives’ work. Giving up on something you love, no matter how stubborn or futile that ‘something’ can be, is almost impossible.”
Kacey looked out the window. There at the end of the driveway, next to the makeshift coop by the garage, sat Big Boy alone. “Yeah... I know what that feels like.” She rubbed her eyes, for no other reason than to give her hands something to do. “And how do you know this story? Secret soul nerd?”
Diane’s smile was unmistakable. “Go on, Alex. You can tell this one.”
He cleared his throat dramatically. “Once upon a time, two recent high school graduates from suburban Pittsburgh decided to spend the summer bumming around the UK. The pair, looking for something fun and cheap to do on a Saturday night, stumbled upon The Twisted Wheel dance hall in Manchester. Soon after arriving they met ‘The Captain,’ a mod girl in an off-yellow bowling shirt and a pair of dark grey pants she stole from her brother. By Sunday morning, the pair became a trio.”
“Wait... is that you he’s talking about?”
Diane nodded.
“Get out!” exclaimed Kacey, her Western Pennsylvanian drawl momentarily
taking hold. “I didn’t know you’re British! And why the fuck did you call yourself ‘The Captain?’”
“Diane Amelia Hennessy, born 22nd January 1952; London. I wanted to see the world so badly back then, but...” She sighed. “Those kinds of opportunities didn’t come around for working-class girls from Oldham. That’s why I created the alter-ego of The Captain. She got to see and do all of the things I knew wouldn’t be able to.”
“...But you did get out. And you did get to see the world.”
“Which I’m still completely shocked by,” Diane responded, shifting back to her original seated position. “The outfit still fits me, by the way. Remind me to show you later.”
“I will. I think I’d look adorable as a quasi-mod.” Kacey paused, waiting just long enough to allow her silence to do most of the talking. “You, I mean. I would never ask to borrow a 70-year-old vintage outfit or anything, even though we’re the exact same size.”
“We’ll work something out. And speaking of going places...” Diane smacked her husband playfully in the shoulder. “Don’t we have somewhere special to be right now?”
“Right! The show!” The car began to lurch forward, scaring whatever few ducks remained back to higher ground. “So Kace... Theo told me you’re still looking for the vinyl duck statue of your dreams. Any leads yet?”
“Strike two, dear,” Diane shot back.
But Al-Stu wasn’t deterred. “Don’t be so quick to poo-poo the statue idea, Dee-Dee. A three-dimensional rendering of Big Boy over there will be easier to procure than the vinyl you’re actually looking for. And you won’t get the headache that’ll come with Tara staring blankly in your general direction, unsure how to process genuine human emotion.”
“I hate when you’re right, you know that? Bloody hell.” Kacey could see Diane shaking her head. “But yeah, putting all of this time and effort into a person who won’t reciprocate isn’t the smartest thing you’ve ever done.”
68

“Respectfully disagree. Let’s face facts here: the man doesn’t have anybody right now. The Collective is breaking apart before our very eyes and Owen’s entire family is gone. I thought by...” Kacey groaned, a million unorganized thoughts floating in her head. “Big Boy needs a good neck scratchin’ every damn time I go outside. Those soul singers needed a dance hall full of disaffected teenagers singing their songs. Mike and Dizzee needed a bunch of Americans listening to their 45s. Maybe me finding that album is what Tara needs to show him that that I... I... I... mean, we... are there for him.”
“...You’re going to get your heart ripped out ...” countered Al-Stu in a condescending falsetto.
“Don’t care. This is who I am. You should know that by now.” Kacey leaned back in her seat. “But enough of this talking. I want to hear what David Byrne and company have to say again! Make it so, Cap’n Hennessy!”
“I shouldn’t have let Alex tell you that,” said Diane. “You’ll never let this go, will you?”
“Nope! The things we do to make our friends happy, right Cap’n?” Diane sighed loudly once again. “Bloody hell...”
Al-Stu laughed as the song began to play once more.

Part Four: Kelly Novak
Dateline: Giant Eagle, Cranberry Twp., PA - Wednesday, June 26th, 2041; 7:10 PM
#1 on the Pittsburgh Reclamation Charts: “Forget About You” by The Motors Original Release Date: May 1978
Weeks at #1: Three
“I can’t believe you left the house looking like that.”
Kacey moved to the dead center of the aisle and put her hands on her hips, feet jutting out ever so slightly. The vintage outfit, much to her quiet surprise, didn’t shoot up, tear or otherwise crumble under the pressure of the moment. Her long, messy pixie cut, a true last-minute decision, served as the look’s proverbial exclamation point. “Bullshit!” she announced, making sure the four or five people currently visiting the pet food aisle stared in their general direction. “I look adorable. Am I right, gang?”
The rest of the shoppers walked by, not acknowledging her grand question.
“They agree with me. They’re just too conscious of your feelings to say anything right now.”
“Let’s say that,” Kelly replied, reaching for a bag of cat food on the top shelf. “The clothes, as objectionable as I find them, are one thing. But did you really have to go for the haircut, too?”
“Yes!” Kacey broke her pose, moving next to their nearly empty shopping carts. “The hair makes the clothes, Kelly! You used to work in a salon! How do you not know this?”
“First off, I did nails,” she clarified, grabbing a can as they walked by. “Hair’s my Kryptonite. Secondly, there are plenty of people who don’t switch things up for a night in the grocery store.”
“Giant Eagle has never seen a person who looked as I do right now,” said Kacey, quickly adding: “...excluding those times when people stop in after proms and weddings and whatever. Those don’t count.”
“Sure,” Kelly answered at the very top of the aisle. “Whatever you say.”
“Damn right. I knew...” Kacey started to forge ahead, only to freeze immediately on the song change. “Oh my God I love this song! Have you heard this yet, Kelly? They’ve been playing it nonstop on ‘DVE for...” She looked around, her gaze darting from spot to spot with no clear rhyme or reason. “Kelly? Where the hell did you go?”
“...Next aisle over!” rang a voice in the distance. “By the bags!”
“Wha... Oh! One second!” As Kacey turned the corner, she noticed that every person passing by was softly singing along. By the time she and her cart reached Kelly’s position, she had willingly joined in.
“Took you long enough.”
“Yeah, well...” Kacey threw two boxes of biodegradable straws into her cart. “Did you hear my question?”
“I did,” replied Kelly. “I have loved this song since the late 70s. Still have the original 45 and everything. Really great stuff.”
 70

“What? How? Are you secretly British too? How much stuff did yinz keep from the Kristens?”
Kelly laughed. “I, unlike the Antolines, didn’t hide anything from you. You’re the idiot who thought that limiting access to your past Acts was a good idea, not me.”
“Fair enough,” she grumbled. “Now answer my question.”
“Theodore, of course. He used to send me LPs and 45s of UK bands he thought I’d like all the time. I got this in late ’78, right after it broke into the top twenty over there. He did stuff like that for all of us, remember?”
“I...” Kacey’s eyes grew wide, a wave of fragmented memories washing over her. “That’s right! He used to send Kristen #1 audio recordings of Doctor Who! I wonder if I still have them...”
“Tara got those as well. I wanted to punch stupid Tom Baker in his stupid face so badly...”
“Best Doctor ever,” said Kacey.
“Low bar, that.” The two made their way through, grabbing various essentials and necessities as they walked past. Suddenly, Kacey saw Kelly point to the ceiling. “You know, this song really reminds me of you.”
“Me?” she asked, the confusion apparent in her voice. “Why? I didn’t break anyone’s heart then immediately regret my decision. Well, not that I currently know of, at any rate.”
“Both you and Nick Garvey up there are pining for a relationship that can never happen. I know you don’t want to hear this, but Tara simply doesn’t have that sort of thing in him anymore. I’m speaking from experience here.”
“For the last time,” Kacey began, turning in Kelly’s general direction, “I am not ‘pining’ for Tara. I’m merely on the lookout for an album for a friend. That’s all. I have no romantic intent here. Zip.”
“Whatever you say, Kace. Maybe you’ll finally convince yourself of that crock of shit eventually.”
“Despite popular opinion to the contrary, life is not a romantic comedy,” Kacey shot back. “We’re not going to meet in the rain or right when the chorus of our favorite song hits or whatever other contrived bullshit those stories would have you believe.”
“So, so much to unpack there,” Kelly snickered. “I, for one, sure as hell hope your favorite song isn’t playing. Having a rom-com end to the chorus freaking ‘Flame Trees’ would be depressing as hell.”
“I said our favorite song, Kel - ‘Daydream Believer’ by The Monkees. Goes back to the first night Owen and I met. We were watching the 1989 Batman, when...” Kacey groaned. “I’m going to stop while I’m ahead. Is that alright?”
“Kace, you were never ‘ahead.’ Trust me on that.” Kelly walked over to the left, stopping at the very edge of the meat cases. “And would you be bothered if I bought some beef right now?”
“Now, as in ‘this very second with me, a committed animal rights person, standing directly in front of you?’ That ‘now?’”
Kelly nodded.
“Yes I would. So very, very much. In fact, I’m wondering what the hell you’re thinking even asking such a thing!” An idea slowly, methodically began to form in
71

Kacey’s head. A compromise that, if effective, would ease both of their respective concerns. She pushed her buggy over, stopping just shy of the frozen poultry case. “Say... You up for something a little different?”
“Depends,” responded Kelly. “What do you have in mind?”
“From this very moment to 5:00 PM the Friday before Labor Day, I will officially suspend my Tara-fueled wild duck chase. No calling stores, trips to God knows where or related conversations of any kind. You, on the other hand, will have to go vegetarian. That means no meat, no Jell-O and no cheese made from the stomach goo of animals. Milk, butter, free-range duck eggs raised with care in the shed by my garage and all the other cheeses are still okay, however. Fair deal?”
“If it means you’ll finally drop this obsession you have, then yes. I’ll agree to anything at this point. If...” Kelly once again gestured towards the speaker on the ceiling as the song began to shift. “Hey... Aren’t they playing one of your songs, ace face?”
“Good use of the lingo, but...” Kacey shook her head, a knowingly condescending smirk on her face. She considered herself to be an expert of the Northern soul movement, despite the fact she had only known about it for a touch shy of two months. “Umm... No...”
“Oh really?” Kelly remarked, her arms folded. “Care to elaborate?”
“First of all, this is ‘Higher and Higher.’ No DJ in their right mind would play something this well-known. Secondly, this the Jimmy Barnes version recorded in 1991. Missed the scene by... oh, I don’t know... twenty years?”
“Fine...” she sighed. “If you have -”
“Eh... Who cares? Let’s dance!” Kacey took a few steps back, hitting a small open area free of cases and displays. Three seconds to sync up with the music and... jump kick! Split! Karate chops! By the end of the song, both her and her companion were completely out of breath, albeit for very different reasons.
Kelly gasped, laughing. “What the living fuck was that? Is that real?”
“Very real,” wheezed Kacey as she walked back to her cart. “Diane said she and her friends were having fun. She never mentioned anything about them being any good.”
“That’s pretty apparent. And I still say you look silly as hell in that getup, but...” Kelly paused, “I’ll be damned if you don’t pull the thing off. No one else I know could, Diane included.”
“Thank you.” Kacey leaned forward, her elbows resting on the cart. “And are they playing ‘Forget About You’ again?”
“Yes, they are. People must be really digging this song.” Kelly smiled. “I love being ahead of the curve for once. Nice feeling.”
“I bet. Now come. Allow me to show you all of the tofu, tempeh and plant- based solutions this fine supermarket has to offer.”
The two friends walked towards the ‘vegetarian’ section near the deli, humming the hit of moment the entire way.

Part Five: Jackie DeNucci
Dateline: The Canfield Fair, Canfield, OH - Friday, August 30th, 2041; 5:03 PM
#1 on the Pittsburgh Reclamation Charts: “There Is No Depression in New Zealand” by Blam Blam Blam
Original Release Date: August 8th, 1981
Weeks at #1: Four
“Could you give me a minute?” Kacey asked, her voice easily blending in with the generalized noise and ballyhoo of the crowd. “There’s a... booth... duck... competition... exhibit... over in the...” She let her words slip by, choosing instead to use her half-eaten deep-fried vegan butter on a stick as a crude, inaccurate pointing device. “At any rate, I’ll be back.”
Jackie simply shook her head, her bemused expression saying more than a proper retort ever could.
“Oh come on!” Kacey whined. “I’m allowed to visit other peoples’ ducks if I want to! Don’t do this!”
But no verbal response left her lips. Simply a motherly scowl; the bane of every misbehaving child the world over.
              I’m not mad; just disappointed.
“Come on! Say something!”
“Ducks.” Jackie stated after several excruciating seconds. She took three steps forward. “In the shopping district.”
“Yes, ducks. That’s all. I have to stay abreast of the latest in midwestern, duck-based innovations.” A pause. “Pun not intended.”
“What’s that thing you Americans say?” Jackie wondered aloud, her Aussie accent cutting through the Eastern Ohio chatter surrounding them. “‘If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, then it must be the giant rekkie booth on the corner over there. Unless you plan on hiking over to the pen clear on the other end of the lot, of course.”
“There’s a reclamation booth?” Kacey replied, trying to approximate an appropriate level of surprise. “How ‘bout that...”
A loud, soul crushing sigh slithered out from beside her, killing what little confidence in her scheme she had left.
       So very disappointed. Just you wait until the
          rest of the Collective hears about this.
“What? My deal with Kelly ended...” Kacey studied her heavily scratched watch. “...a whole three minutes ago. If she can dive headfirst into a cow carcass the second her alarm goes off, then I can look -”
“Cark the ear drumming, drogo,” Jackie barked. “Is that...” Another sudden stoppage, complete with a head tilt. “Yep. ‘There Is No Depression in New Zealand.’ Why is a 60-year-old, dull as shit Shaky Land protest anthem playing at an American fair?”
“Huge hit around here,” informed Kacey. “Number one for three weeks.”
73
 
“And how in the fuckin’ hell did you find this? Someone at the local classic hits station beat a 75-year-old Kiwi half to death and steal their all of their worst
45s?”
“Dumb luck, most likely. You know... someone buys something cheap from
the bargain bin; falls in love. That sort of thing.” Kacey leaned in, taking a sip from their shared lemonade. “Besides, you Aussies have no room to talk about song quality these days.”
“Name me one...” Jackie slammed her tirade to a halt, her eyes growing wide. “Oh no. Don’t you fucking dare, mate. I don’t choose the tracks on 4KQ, you know. I have standards! I have taste!”
“Sorry honey. You brought this one on yourself.” Kacey cleared her throat, effecting the best ‘disc jockey’ voice she could muster. ‘...And topping the Brisbane reclamation charts for an unprecedented twentieth week, here’s Aerosmith with ‘Sweet Emotion.’”
“Number one...” she mumbled, her head down. “Pig’s arse that piece of...”
Kacey didn’t stick around to hear the rest. Off she went, walking as fast as she could towards the booth without drawing any unwanted attention. Ten steps away. Seven. Four. And...
A hand suddenly grasped onto her shoulder. “Shit!”
She turned to see Jackie, sporting a look that she hadn’t since early on in her first Act.
     I can’t leave you alone for five seconds, can I?
“I’m sorry about all of this. I...” She sighed, throwing her free hand up in the air. “I don’t know what the hell I’m doing with myself anymore, you know?”
“Right-o.” Jackie pointed over her shoulder in the opposite direction. “Go on a walkabout?”
“Sure. Lead the way.”
The pair marched through the crowded festival in silence, weaving their way through all sorts of antique attractions and theoretically edible delights. A baked potato covered in pulled pork on the left, the worst motorized funhouse 1962 had to offer on the right, Youngstown-style fried cheese straight ahead. Strolling past the facsimile demonstrations, oversized farm tractors and the “cheapest water filtration systems in all of Mahoning County.” Sharp turn around the arts and crafts building, leading to...
“Take a seat,” Jackie gently ordered, gesturing to the rows upon rows of empty folding chairs carefully placed in front of them. On the stage stood a small bluegrass band trying (and failing) to reproduce the greatest hits of 1940s country swing.
“Hey... I know this place! Kristen #1 used to take her grandma here on fair days! Old people love...” Kacey stopped mid-sentence, not wanting to offend the gigging musicians within earshot. She instead slid into a random middle section, finishing what little remained of her butter. “How old do you think I am, exactly?”
“86 cumulative,” answered Jackie as she took the chair on the very end. “Ready for the aged care wing, I reckon. Compared to most of the people here, you’re a bloomin’ dino!”
74

“Been called worse,” Kacey chuckled, slyly averting her gaze. “I... No. Never mind. You didn’t spend six months on a leaky boat to hear me whine.”
“Twenty-five days on a fixed up long hauler, plus three days on a train. Appreciate the reference, though.” Jackie grabbed their lemonade, dumping out the ice but keeping the lemon. “But yeah, mate, I did. Heard on the landie from Kelly that you needed some help, so I started planning straight away. You’d do the same for me.”
“Yeah, I would. Always wanted to see Brisbane; maybe hit up that ‘Echo fair’ you keep talking about. Besides, living on a boat like that sounds fun.”
“Trans-Pacific travel is not enjoyable in the slightest these days. And it’s called the ‘Ekka.’ Think of this place, only with homemade strawberry ice cream and officially branded monster trucks.”
“Monster trucks, you say?” asked Kacey. “Always wanted to meet one of them...”
“Oh, I know.” Jackie smiled and took her hand. “Now I’m going to say something you won’t be too keen on. Is that alright?”
Kacey nodded. “Go on...”
“Tara is a great mate, no doubt. But the man can be a...” Jackie looked around. “Good. Just us. He’s a cunt, Kace. A clueless, nilwit cunt who will never feel the same way you do.”
“And you the fuck are you to make such an assumption?” Kacey snapped. “You never dealt with anything like this! You never seen -”
“Theodore Tahrenna left me in 2017 to be a bleedin’ drifter after his friend died,” Jackie shot back. “My feelings didn’t come into play till years later. So trust me when I say that I understand everything you’re going through right now.”
“But -”
“You have two choices here, I reckon: either drop your silly little crush smart quick and move on or get yourself ready for repeated broken hearts.”
“But... But... But this is more than a ‘crush!’ I need to do this! I...” Kacey trailed off, carefully considering each and every subsequent word. “I’m not used to having a definitive end date on my life. Back before, I could take three weeks, six months, fifteen years to change his heart. But I can’t now. Don’t have the time. None of us do. This Act is all we have left.”
“Facing down death is a scary thing,” Jackie commented.
“Oh God yes. That’s why won’t stop looking for that record. Maybe Frank and the boys will jumpstart...” Kacey groaned, forcing herself to pull whatever she could from the fog rapidly enveloping her mind. “Long story short, I end up pushing myself a little more than I normally would. Going just a touch faster. But none of that is working this time. All I’m doing is getting more and more obsessed with a wish that will never come true. And this obsession is leading to other obsessions, which are taking me down paths I don’t want to take and... and... Oh God. I can’t do this. I... I just can’t do this.”
With that, Kacey began to hyperventilate.
She knew, at least on some level, that Jackie was doing what she could to aid in the situation. But still, she kept gasping. The fear of a million implausible scenarios reared their nonexistent heads simultaneously, overtaking every synapse. Thoughts about Tara. Thoughts about the technological disruption. Thoughts about
75

people, places and things that have no logical relation to one another. Nothing mattered; everything mattered. Over and over the onslaught came, adding more fuel to an already ridiculous situation. By the time she finally calmed down, the band had stopped playing. She looked over to her friend, tears in her eyes. “Jackie? I think I have a problem.”
“I know, love,” Jackie answered. “But don’t worry. I don’t start my journey back till 3rd November. We can get through this. That’s the good thing about befriending an Aussie. Once we finally show up, we never fuckin’ leave!”
“No, you don’t. And you don’t know how happy that makes me right now.” She turned her head towards the stage. “Hey... Do yinz guys know ‘There Is No Depression in New Zealand?’ Kind of fits my mood n’at. And follow that up with ‘Six Months in a Leaky Boat’ by Split Enz for my friend here. And ‘Sweet Emotion’ if you know it.”
Moments later, a raucous, fiddle and banjo take on two smash hits (and possibly, a golden oldie) filled the space around them. Kacey swiveled back to her original position, stealing a glance from her temporary roommate, live-in counselor and one-person support system.
      You can get through this. I believe in you, I’m
              rooting for you, and I love you.
The two friends hugged tightly, not letting go until the first song ended. No other words were necessary.

Part Six: Carrie Roberts and Bill Mediate
Dateline: Pittsburgh National, Moon Twp., PA - Sunday, November 3rd, 2041; 10:15 AM
#1 on the Pittsburgh Reclamation Charts: “Sunshine” by Atmosphere Original Release Date: July 24th, 2007
Weeks at #1: Two
Kacey sighed as she stepped on the escalator connecting the various gates with the multi-purpose concourse below. Remnants of the old days – logos to now defunct multi-million-dollar aeronautic concerns, reminders of security procedures no longer in effect, models of wonderous flying machines – still decorated the various nooks and crannies of the oversized building. Every last one serving as a reminder of what was... and what could possibly never be again. Her gaze drifted downward. “I miss flying,” she mumbled to herself.
“Not me,” a deep, traditionally masculine voice rang out from behind. “I have a steel rod in my leg from playing football in high school. Set off every last one of those dumbass scanners. You don’t know how handsy people can be sometimes.”
“Ah... the lament of the unaware, cisgendered male,” answered their distinctively feminine counterpart. “Talk to me when you’ve had multiple body parts pinched in public simply for not dressing like a nun.”
Carrie and Bill. The college professor and the plumber. Two souls who would have never found the other if not for the disruption. A fluke meeting turned committed romance. The one relationship that everyone, with the possible exception of Al-Stu and Diane, wanted to emulate.
The couple began to chuckle to themselves, immediately forcing Kacey’s to turn her head. “Three stone cold facts: trains suck, Amtrak as a company is several degrees of terrible and Bill would rock the habit in ways neither of us can even fathom. The Little Sisters of the Poor could use a large, balding guy with a rod for a leg.”
“Can’t step into a Catholic Church,” replied Bill, pointing at the rapidly encroaching terrace. “I’d catch fire.”
“As would we all. I -” Kacey paused for a moment, nearly tripping on the bottom of the escalator. “Those platforms just come up on you, don’t they?”
Both Bill and Carrie began to laugh, each stepping off with nary a hiccup.
“You two make disembarking look easy,” Kacey said, walking over to the sparse shopping and dining options to the right. “But seriously, when are the planes going to come back? People flew before digital equipment, you know.”
“They already are, provided you can afford a private license, an absurdly expensive plane and have a place to put the thing. If you’re talking about jumbo jets...” Carrie sighed, shaking her head, “Not in our lifetime, I’m afraid. Barring some left field, speculative bullshit like teleportation or the hyperloop finally taking hold, I think we’ll be stuck with Amtrak for the foreseeable future.”
“Dammit.” Kacey waited a beat. “Hey... Do you mind if I took a moment? I need to collect myself.”
“Sure,” said Bill. “In the meantime... do you want some coffee? I’m buying...” 77
 
“God yes. Medium soy latte; two sugars.”
“Can do.”
“Thanks, Bill.” Kacey leaned against a wall, her back pressed against a poorly
obscured American Airlines logo. Eyes closed; mind open. Sounds surrounded her. A squeaky wheel on a luggage cart. The thump of the escalator. Laughing and talking and... “Atmosphere?”
“What’s that?” Carrie asked. Judging by the sound and quality of her voice, Kacey quickly surmised that she had to be standing right beside her. “You can hear the atmosphere now? What kind of meditation techniques did Jackie teach you?”
“The hip-hop group, not space. Someone’s blasting ‘Sunshine’ right now. Not that I’m complaining. Love that song.”
“Me too.” Carrie offered no immediate follow-up, waiting for the chorus to properly kick in first. “You seem good today.”
“I am,” she chirped. “Which quite frankly shocks the hell out of me. I’d thought I’d be a nervous wreck with Jackie leaving.”
“But you aren’t. That’s progress, right there.”
Kacey nodded, a small smile slipping through.
“And how much of this whole thing does Tara know?”
“Enough,” she responded. “He knows I have an anxiety issue, and that I’m
trying to control things through meditation and self-care instead of Ativan and Acapulco Gold. He doesn’t have a clue about the rest. Never will, as far as I’m concerned,”
“Good call. Tara’s never been ‘emotionally available,’ shall we say. Nice to see you thinking on your feet.”
“Kelly’s idea. Laud her.” Kacey slowly and carefully lowered herself to the floor below, crossing her legs shortly after she made contact. “I... I never realized how much people outside of the Collective still don’t understand about anxiety and depression. They would rather ‘explain away the lunatic’ or spout some half-baked political theory than listen. Spoiler: these feelings aren’t new.”
“That’s because people,” she began with a movement-derived groan, “are scared to death at thought of mental illness. Easier to cast doubt and blame than look inside.”
“Bullseye!” Kacey paused, taking a few deep breaths in order to calm her nerves and right her mind. “Do you know how many times I’ve been asked if Tara’s rejection drove me off the deep end? Well I hate to break this to yinz, but my mental health isn’t centered around the whims of the boy I like. This whole thing was a long time in coming.”
“So you’ve realized that 20th century gender inequality is alive and well and living in Pittsburgh,” mused Carrie. “I see it every single day at Pitt. Good thing Bill isn’t like that. I would’ve kicked his ass out years ago.”
“And I get why. Like...” She rested her head against the wall. “Take your average cis man. Old-fashioned type. They own property on Easy Street. Now let’s say he gets dumped. He gets upset, drinks, whatever. Totally normal. Power pop and 80s movies and 1970s R&B slow jams are full of that shit. Now look at me. What do I get? Some male nurse asking me if I know how to boil a rabbit.”
“Jesus! Real deep cut there. That scene didn’t make the remake.”
78

“I know, right?” shouted Kacey, only catching herself after she finished the thought. “The original Fatal Attraction is like fifty-something years old and hasn’t been shown on mainstream television in years! How do people younger than 70 even know about that film?”
“Mysteries of the universe, my friend,” Kacey felt an arm go around her shoulder. “That’s the great thing about our lifestyle. We had the chance to grow out of the old ways of thinking. Become better people.”
“Oh yes. And I thank... “She turned, cracking her right eye open. “...who exactly does an atheist thank in situations like these? Themselves? Darwin? The Scientific Method?”
“You’re asking the wrong professor,” Carrie answered, smiling. “I do history, not philosophy. But in your case, I’d probably just thank Big Boy the duck and move on.”
“Praise be Big Boy.” Kacey counted silently from “five,” giving the next statement the proper amount of emotional padding. “So much has changed in the past nine, ten years for us. If you would have told me in 2031 that I would be dropping my friend off at an airport-turned-train station so she could eventually take a big ass boat across the Pacific Ocean, I’d have laughed in your face. But do you know what hasn’t changed? Yinz guys. I needed help, so you helped. Theo took me to Canada when he thought I needed to leave the house, Jenna bought concert tickets for the whole Collective. My sister Delilah is cooking a special vegetarian Thanksgiving dinner just for me. No double standards or institutionalized sexism here. Nope. Nothing but love.”
“We do what we can,” she said. “While we’re on the subject, I need to ask: are you finally giving up on your search?”
“Nope. But -”
Carrie groaned loudly.
“Let me finish before you get all hot and bothered.” Kacey turned her head
once again, making full-on eye contact in rather short order. “I’m looking for Frank as a friend, for a friend. That’s all. No different than what you’ve all done for me.”
“I’m holding you to that. And I -”
“Hey guys!” Bill yelled as he walked over to their position, somehow carrying three coffee cups without spilling them. “Did you hear they were playing ‘Sunshine’ by Atmosphere? Love that song. Makes me feel so damn good.”
“Me too.” Kacey grabbed her cup and smiled.
He handed Carrie her usual – a large peppermint mocha – before taking a seat alongside them. “Please don’t take this the wrong way Kacey, but I admire you.”
“Me? Why?”
“The way you dealt with all your stuff.” Bill plucked the two chocolate covered coffee beans off of his lid, handing one of each to Kacey and Carrie. “As this one might have told you, I’ve been through my fair share of mental bullshit. For a long time – years – I thought I was the problem. I mean, I have nothing to bitch about, right? I got a wonderful partner, a thriving business, I can see my folks in Greensburg on the regular... Livin’ the dream. I should be getting happier, not sadder. Then I realized something. I realized these crappy feelings have always been there, hanging out in the background. They simply masked themselves as something
79

else. Money or the disruption or what have you. You strip those things away, and all you have left is the sadness. The loathing.”
Kacey nodded.
“You... You didn’t stay quiet. At the first sign of trouble, you asked for help. Wish I did that. Maybe the end of the last decade wouldn’t have sucked so damn
badly.”
“Thanks, Bill,” she said, looking down at her cup.
He gave a quick thumbs up. “And I gotta know: did anyone say you were only
sad because you loved and lost? Hate that shit. Happened to my sister once. Some pharmacist told her that depression pills don’t cure broken hearts and that maybe should learn to control whatever drama drove her girlfriend away. Long story short, I had to bail her out of the Westmorland County lockup for punching him in the face.”
“A nurse asked her if she knew how to boil rabbits,” informed Carrie.
“Like in that old movie with Cruella De Vil and Ant-Man? A punch in a face would be too good for them!”
“And there’s that movie again!” Kacey began to laugh. “But yeah... he really is one of the good ones.”
“I think I’ll keep him,” said Carrie. “And don’t worry about whatever might be coming your way next. Just remember that you’ll be fine... as long Big Boy is still watching over you.”
“You don’t know how true that statement is,” she answered.

Part Seven: Delilah Holzinger and Family
Dateline: The Home of Delilah and Joe Holzinger, Brentwood Borough, PA - Thursday, November 28th, 2041 (Thanksgiving); 11:25 AM
#1 on the Pittsburgh Reclamation Charts: “Take Me High” by Cliff Richard Original Release Date: November 1973
Weeks at #1: Three
The rectangular box glowed brightly, illuminating the back wall of the Holzinger family’s living room. Since its introduction into family life a mere eleven months prior, the television served as a both a gathering spot and the clan’s chief provider of semi-quality entertainment. They received a grand total of ten stations using their modified rabbit ears – a paltry number to Delilah and Joe, but completely unthinkable to their children.
“Look, Aunt Kacey!” gasped Emily, squeezing her arm with a surprising amount of force. “Santa’s here! He’s here! I mean, there! I mean almost there. I mean...” She stopped cold, leaning forward. “Denise! Move! I won’t be able to see Santa! If I can’t see him then he can’t see me! And if he can’t see me, then I... I don’t know what will happen!”
“...But Santa always gets to see you first!” whined Denise, parked mere inches from the screen. “I want to go first this time!”
“No! I...” Emily sighed, slumping back down into the sofa. “Fine.”
Kacey couldn’t help but smile. “That’s nice of you.”
“I try,” she responded.
“Oh, I know.” Kacey glanced up, getting a brief glimpse of a high school band –
the Blue Valley North Marching Mustangs from Overland Park, Kansas – playing an instantly recognizable chart-topper. “Didn’t see this one coming,” she said to herself.
A foot and change above and to the right of the television hung a wall mount, a reinforced steel throne built for a king-sized flat screen. But the king was, most regrettably, dead. Only the chair remained, a relic from a future that had long since passed society by.
But “unneeded” didn’t necessarily mean “unused.” Festive pieces of holiday kitsch took the place of the shared space’s deposed monarch, proudly serving whatever fragments of the court remained. An aging, inflatable rabbit (and various bungee cords) for Easter; a smiling sun for the Summer Solstice; dual pictures of Sitting Bull and actor Robert DeNiro for what some might have called “Columbus Day.” But November remained the sole domain of “Tommy Maddox,” a cardboard turkey fitted with both a Steelers helmet sticker and, in a last-minute addition, a label for extra-firm tofu.
“Did you see what I added to Tommy, Aunt Kacey?” Emily asked in what should have been a whisper. “Did ya? Did ya?”
“I most certainly did. Did you do that for me?”
Emily nodded enthusiastically.
“Well, I thank you very much for making me feel welcome.”
“Oh! And one more thing!” She took an overly dramatic breath. “I told my
mom I couldn’t eat meat anymore because I kept on thinking of your ducks and I
81
 
don’t want to eat your ducks so I said ‘Aunt Kacey doesn’t eat meat and I don’t wanna either’ then mom said ‘okay.’ We’re eating tofu together! Is that alright?”
“You don’t know how happy that makes me,” Kacey commented, watching Emily out of the corner of her eye. “Remind me to make you some seitan the next time you visit. I have a special recipe. Top secret.”
“Meat bread! I love meat bread! We’ll eat some, then me and you can -” Emily stopped suddenly, a soft groan eventually sneaking through. “...Never mind. You and mom are too sick to have fun ever again.”
“I’m sick?” she asked, trying to maintain her sunny disposition. “No one told me...”
“Brain sick,” Emily intoned. “You get worried and you stop being you until Australia sends help. Mom’s all the other sick. I hate when yinz get sick. That means no one can ever be happy again because nothing can ever be fixed.”
“Oh honey...” Kacey threw her right arm over the back of the sofa. “Would you like to hear a story about a special person?”
Emily nodded.
“Good. Now, once upon a time, there was this writer – a talented chap from
Australia named Tony. He wrote songs. Sang them too, for the most part. But no one outside of his hometown liked Tony’s music. ‘Boring,’ they said. ‘Lightweight.’ After a few years and countless cracks at glory, he quit music to become an English teacher.”
“Oh...” Emily exhaled. “That’s sad...”
“Yes, but I’m not finished yet.” Kacey gestured towards the television, now showing a local advertisement. “A year or two ago, a DJ from Kansas City stopped into a reclamation shop to find something different to play. There, in a random corner, sat Tony’s two albums. She grabbed both on the cheap, went home and gave them both a listen. She loved them, to the point she played them in their entirety on the air the next day. And again. And again. Turned out, all of Kansas City loved Tony’s songs just as much as she did. He’s so popular now that a marching band chose one of his compositions to play on live, nationwide TV. The whole Macy’s parade started to cheer and sing and have a grand ol’ time. Tony would’ve wanted nothing less.”
“Alright, I guess. But I...” She shook her head. “Never mind.”
Kacey snapped her fingers, forcing her niece to make eye contact. “Emmy? Listen to me. Failing on the first try doesn’t mean that all is lost. Took Tony seventy years to get to today. I needed 91 and a meltdown at a fair. The mount up there can’t hold a modern TV to save its life. But somehow, despite the missteps and the bullshit we deal with on a daily basis, happy endings can and do still happen if you let them. Tony got his posthumous celebration, I found what worked for me and the mount became best friends with Tommy.”
“They’re engaged,” Denise volunteered, her gaze staying locked on the screen in front of her. “Different thing. Mom said so.”
“Close enough for the moment. Now if you’d give me just one second here...” Kacey indulged in one calming deep breath, in and out, before sending her point on home. “That’s better. I’ll be honest here: No one knows how long your mom’s ordeal will take to beat or what special thing she needs in order to get the job done. But as
82

long as she has you and Denise and your dad her side, the chances of her ultimately beating this remain strong.”
“Okay, Aunt Kacey.” She pointed her gaze downward. Her hands began to shake. “Can I tell you something? No one else knows this.”
“Then I promise I won’t say a word. What’s up?”
“I...” Emily locked Kacey into an approximation of an expert bear hug. “I get worried about stuff too. I start thinking and thinking and thinking some more then I start shaking and...” She paused. “Does that mean I’m brain sick too? Do I have to call Australia? Can mine be a kangaroo? And what does ‘pasta mouth’ mean?”
“First of all,” Kacey began, “you’re not ‘brain sick.’ You and I simply have some anxiety issues. I’ll show you what to do when you feel all worried after dinner. That way, you don’t need to call the South Pacific or talk to a kangaroo. Is that alright?”
She nodded quickly, her head coming into accidental contact with various portions of Kacey’s torso.
“And the word I used earlier was ‘posthumous,’ not ‘pasta mouth.’ It refers to something that happens after a person has passed on.”
“I’m sad again for Tony. Still, better than nothing. If we -” Emily looked up, suddenly falling back to her seat. “Hi mom! Hi dad! Aunt Kacey and I were talking about secrets and kangaroos and pasta! Want to join in?”
“We’re good,” answered Delilah. “Could you and your sister go upstairs for a bit? Your dad and I want to talk your aunt alone. We have the parade on in our bedroom.”
“But -”
“We told Santa about the room change. He’s cool. I promise.” Delilah counted backwards from ‘ten’ – loud enough for Kacey to hear, but subtle enough that Emily and Denise wouldn’t catch on. “Now, Emily.”
“Okay.” Emily gave her aunt one final squeeze before running up the stairs with her younger sister. “We’re comin’ Santa! Don’t start without us! You won’t catch my brain sick!”
“Isn’t Emmy a little old to still believe in supernatural gift giving?” Kacey asked, waiting until after the door slammed shut to pose the question. “We found out the truth when we were eight.”
“We’re going to tell her next year.” Delilah took a seat next to Kacey on the sofa, while the six-foot-plus Joe attempted to hide in plain sight. “You’re looking good, Cassie. Better than me these days.”
“About that...” Kacey leaned forward, hands in her lap. “Are you sick? I mean, I think you look fine. But Emily said a few things and... you know how I get sometimes.”
Delilah threw her hands up and shook her head. “I’m fine. Denise gave me the flu a few weeks ago. Damn thing set up camp in my chest. But that’s not what we wanted to talk to you about.”
She tilted her head. “Oh? I don’t see what could be more important than -”
“For the first time in a decade, we finally get to give you your Christmas present early. Close your eyes.”
“I don’t see why,” muttered Kacey, her eyelids slamming shut. “I never made you be all theatrical.”
83

“That’s because you’re boring. Now... Open!”
Kacey stared at the object in utter disbelief.
Couldn’t be. No way. But then again...
She pulled the sleeve closely, mere inches away from her face. Checklist time! Capitol Records? Check.
Purple background contrasting with Sinatra’s blue suit? Check.
Conducted by Nelson Riddle? Check.
Four bonus tracks? Quadruple check.
Everything Tara said not but a year prior, all in the right places. She took a
breath, trying to formulate the proper words for the moment. Something calm, yet obviously appreciative.
Three, two, one and...
“HOLY FUCKING SHIT! SWING EASY! HOW IN THE UNHOLY FUCK DID YOU FIND THIS?!”
“Joe did,” informed Delilah. “I had to go to the Cleveland Clinic for... you know. Women’s stuff. He popped his head into a reclamation shop to kill some time and... well... this is what he left with.”
“Instant purchase,” added Joe, his deep baritone providing a sharp contrast to the rest of the room. “Deep cleaned and everything.”
“Cleveland... fucking Cleveland.” Kacey looked up. “How much did this cost yinz?”
“Merry Christmas, Cassie,” the couple said simultaneously.
She set the album down, giving both of them a hug Emily herself would be proud of. “Thank you so much...”
“A wise woman once said that happy endings can and do still happen if you let them,” said Delilah. “You should listen to her. She’s pretty great.”
‘I... I will,” Kacey reluctantly pulled away, taking the moment to wipe her eyes with the sleeve of her festive holiday sweater. “Now if you would excuse me, I have an impromptu nightcap to schedule.”
“Go nuts,” Delilah responded. “And Merry Christmas.” Kacey smiled as she made her way to the phone.

Part Eight: Tara Pflugh
Dateline: The Home of Kacey Wagner, New Sewickley Twp., PA - Thursday, November 28th, 2041 (Thanksgiving); 6:50 PM
#1 on the Pittsburgh Reclamation Charts: “Future Me Hates Me” by The Beths Original Release Date: August 10th, 2018
Weeks at #1: Five
Her hands shook; her heart raced. But she knew she needed to remain calm. Show nothing that could possibly give away her –
<Squeak... Slam!>
...And here goes nothing.
“Happy Thanksgiving, Tara,” Kacey said, her eyes locked on the poorly chopped zucchini situated in front of her. “How’s your holiday been?”
“Rather dull, all things considered. Thankfully – and the pun is most definitely intended – the end of my bad tidings is very much in sight.” Tara fell silent, mostly likely to hang up his overcoat and complimentary headwear. “I must say, arriving first to a Collective gathering is an... odd feeling, to say the least. I arrive. I do not greet.”
“First time for everything,” Kacey answered, doing her level-headed best not slip into the biggest anxiety attack her home had ever seen. “Go into the living room. I’ll be right in. We’ll wait together.”
She took a deep breath as he walked by.
He’s just a friend. Remember that. He’s just a friend. He’s not capable of -
“HOLY FUCKING SHIT!” rang his voice from the living room, all but forcing her to drop her chef’s knife. “SWING EASY!”
      Remember: he is just a friend. Got that? Just. A.
      Friend.
She turned to see Tara standing at the edge of the kitchen, record firmly in hand.
“How...” he mumbled. “Where... Why would you even... Oh goodness. Oh... oh my...”
Kacey stayed silent, choosing a knowing smirk and folded arms over a overly long explanation or a witty comeback.
Tara leaned his gift against the wall of the dining room and took a step in her general direction. “I... I realize that I made a mess of things last year. A so-called ‘unforced error’ that I could never fully undo. And a large part of me is certain that this moment, as I most ineloquently stated back then, will not end well for either of us. Feelings like this... In my experience, they make us not to play well with others. Future me, to paraphrase that audio virus you most surely love, will hate me for what I am about to do. Yet I know that if don’t pose the following at this very instant, I will regret it for as long as I have left. You are more than a ‘friendly acquaintance’.”
 85

He fell to one knee, despite not having anything to pose with. “Kacey Wagner, will you marry me?”
She smiled, tears filling her eyes. “Of course I will, you nilwit cunt.”
“Good, because I... um... lo-”
“Swing easy, Tara,” Kacey interrupted. “Swing easy.”
Tara slowly made his way to his feet. “Swing easy, special one. Swing easy.”

Chapter Fourteen: Daydream Believer
Dateline: Three Rivers Bar and Grill, Pittsburgh (Strip District), PA - Thursday, June
26th, 2042; 7:50 PM
Comments, By Caroline: For those in attendance, this night will remain in their
memories for all eternity.
Blue suit; white dress. Their honored guests (and a lone photograph of Big Boy the duck) surrounded the bar floor turned dance floor. Two steps forward. Hands together. Signal to Theodore. Needle down. The hiss and crackle of the vinyl filled the space, a predictable preamble to a well-loved classic. Heads up; eye contact made. The dance began in earnest.
Music choice was, as predicted, a monumental problem for all involved. Kacey initially requested “Flame Trees,” the top reclamation hit of 2040 and easily her favorite song of all time. Tara instantly vetoed the suggestion, rightly pointing out that dancing to a song about old friends helping a person get over a bad breakup would be a bit too “on the nose.” He envisioned something a touch classier; perhaps a regional legend like Dean Martin or Perry Como. Alas, neither Dino’s potent mix of “sex, booze and Italian imagery” nor Perry’s penchant for accidental lullabies fit Kacey’s vision of the “perfect reception.” In the end, only one track appeared on both of their lists: an instantly recognizable, late 1960s pop smash called “Daydream Believer.”
On the surface, the couple appeared to be incompatible. The sadly defunct digital world versus the improbably resurgent analog one. RoboCop and Blade Runner versus Dune and Batman. And yet, as they stood cheek to cheek, none of their supposed differences mattered. Two people, lucky to have found each other when they did; striving to make the other happy. Nothing could make the moment mean more than it already did. Nothing except...
“Everybody now!” yelled Theodore, the chorus beginning to swell.
With that, the entire room burst into song. Around the edge of the floor they went, each and every person contributing in their own, unique way. Some sounded better than they ever had. Others reminded them of the lone, flat soprano their various Acts would inevitably end up sitting behind at Catholic mass. All sounded perfect.
Theodore lowered the volume on the turntable as the music began to fade. “And now, for the first time, I proudly present Cassidy Kristen Pflugh and Tara Owen Wagner!”
Their guests immediately broke in a loud, sustained applause.
Tara leaned in, barely able to control his emotions. “No matter what happens to us in the future, I will always swing easy.”
Kacey smiled, tears of joy running down her face.

Chapter Fifteen: Closer to Fine
Dateline: The Home of Kacey Pflugh and Tara Wagner, New Sewickley Twp., PA -
Saturday, January 30th, 2049; 1:38 PM
Diatribes, By DL: A mere six and a half years later...
“Aunt Kacey?” echoed a voice throughout the home. “You down here? I asked the ducks, but they ain’t talkin’.”
“Living room, Emmy!” Kacey rested her well-worn copy of Dune on the nearby end table and began to stretch, trying desperately to ignore the various snaps and pops in her shoulder. “Did you get through the driveway okay?”
“Yeah. No problem.” Emily set her beloved portable facsimile machine – a sturdy, top-of-the-line model she called “Liv” - on the edge of the dining room table before walking over. “You alright? You were wincing pretty bad just now.”
“Here’s a tip, honey: don’t get old,” she responded with a tired, albeit genuine, smile. “Now hold still. I want to see something.”
Kacey took a half-step back, all the while staring at the person in front of her. Emily Holzinger. A senior at sixteen. A person who understood more about love, loss and the points in between than those thrice her age. Someone who had the confidence to make a faded orange shirt (with detachable sleeves) and semi- formless red slacks look at least somewhat fashionable. And yet, the only things she could think about were the days that had come before. The hyperactive child who spoke in run-on sentences and had an unnatural attachment to Santa Claus. Before long, a small grin began to form.
“Don’t, Aunt Kacey,” Emily warned suddenly, pushing her extra-long “ponyhawk” into position behind her head. “Don’t.”
“What?” She laughed. “I’m not doing anything! Honest!”
“Yes, you are. I see that faux-mom, ‘I am so damn proud’ look on your face. You’re going to say something sweet and mushy, then start to cry. Then I’ll cry. Then we’ll spend the whole time crying instead of discussing...” She shook her head. “No. I’ve had this visit planned in my head for months now. Can’t go off-schedule. Not even for a second.”
“’Planned for months?’ That’s wild. I don’t know what the hell I’m doing later today.” Kacey waited a beat, gesturing Emily towards the worn sectional sofa separating the living and dining rooms. “So... What’s on your mind? Did you finally pick a school? I hear the University of Pittsburgh is lovely this time of year...”
“Nah... the scholarship boards can wait,” Emily replied, taking the middle seat. “I heard about what happened to Big Boy the other day. The driveway doesn’t seem the same without him.”
“Yeah, well...” She sighed, sinking into the couch cushions. “Twenty years is good for a Muscovy. Nineteen more than your mom would’ve given him.”
“‘Ducks aren’t pets, Emmy!’” her niece shouted, affecting her late mother’s voice with expert precision. “‘The only animals worth keeping are cats and dogs! Maybe horses, but only if you’re crazy!’”
88

“Dogs? Delilah got soft in her old age.” Kacey turned her head, getting a brief glimpse of the pristine white tundra that laid beyond her patio doors. “Been a year already. Blows my mind.”
“Me too. I stopped irrationally blaming myself months ago, but, I... I kind of wish I still did, as dumb as that sounds. I mean... There’s nothing I could do about cancer. I’m not a doctor. But then...” Her breathing began to quicken. Her hand began to shake. “Then...”
“That’s okay,” Kacey interjected. “I get where you’re coming from. We can change the subject.”
“No, Aunt Kacey. I can get through this. Just give me a few.” Emily closed her eyes, no doubt employing the myriad of breathing techniques Kacey had taught her years before. In and out; nice and slow.
Kacey joined in, if for no other reason than to stop her tears of pride from making a tenuous situation worse. She sat in silence, eyes closed, until she felt a tap on her shoulder. “You alright?”
“Good enough,” Emily assured her, sneaking one more breath in along the way. “I hate the guilt. But I hate the big, empty mom-shaped pit worse. At least loathing gives me something real to focus on.”
“I get what you’re saying, but...” Kacey gestured towards the television stand. On the rightmost corner of the unit, sandwiched in between a refurbished VCR and a stack of tapes, sat a faded Polaroid of two haggard sisters and a reluctant duck. “The boys at the yard took that a mere thirteen months after the disruption. Still can’t get over how good your mom’s hair color looks. No fades, no streaks. And to think, yinz didn’t even have running water at the time!”
Emily turned her head. “Um... I didn’t know we didn’t have water...”
“Yeah. Lines at your house were dead for almost two years.
Kacey paused. “But do you know what bothered her the most out of everything?
Losing your baby pictures.”
“What?!” she exclaimed. “Tell me if I’m off base here, but isn’t ‘get the water
turned on’ a little more important?”
“Not for her. Losing the first year and some of your life tore Delilah up inside.
Luckily, I had a Christmas miracle-level present waiting in the other room. Made her decade.”
“Denise has the camera now,” Emily commented softly. “Goes everywhere with her. Do you realize how much hockey players love to take pictures of themselves? The answer is a bunch. A whole, whole bunch.”
“And do you know why she loves that camera, aside from the fact that fourteen-year-olds are genetically inclined to adore bad photography?”
She shook her head.
“That camera,” Kacey began, “is how your sister fills that empty space left by Delilah’s passing. Each Polaroid is memory of someone she loved very, very much. Now tell me, Emmy: What do you have to remember her by?”
“I... um...” she panted. “I... I don’t want to talk about this anymore. Is that alright?”
“Of course. I’ll make this quick then.” Kacey leaned over, grabbing a glass- encased item from the table in front of them. “Do you know what this is?”
89

“...Paperweight?” guessed Emily, snatching the object out of Kacey’s lap. She held item closely, mouth agape. “Is this... is this a cellphone? A real cellphone?”
“Your mom’s cellphone, to be precise. The one filled with pictures of you. I grabbed this right after I gave her the Polaroid. This belongs to you.”
“W-What?” she stammered. “Keep this! I’m not the only one who misses her, you know! I can find something else!”
“I have my own mementos of you mother. Speaking of, remind me to show...” Kacey stopped abruptly, trying to keep her Act-specific emotions at arm’s length. “Anyway... before I give this to you, I need you to assure me that you won’t lose, damage or otherwise harm the gift you’re holding. Because this isn’t simply a random piece of nonfunctioning tech. This is special.”
Emily wrapped her arms around Kacey, nearly knocking her over in the process. “Thank you so, so very much! This is going to stay with me forever! I promise!”
She nodded, somehow slipping out of the hold after a few minutes. “Now... What did you want to talk to me about?”
“Not quite.” Emily took a loud, deep breath, the phone still secure on her person. “I’ve been talking and reading up on things and I came to the realization that I’m... I’m genderfree.”
“I think you mean ‘enby,’” corrected Kacey. “Genderfrees harass people in bathrooms and hide razor blades in offensive posters. So, what’s the big news?”
“...I just told you.” She tilted her head. “Wait... You knew? How did you find out?”
“I remember the polo shirts and pink sparkly mittens from when you were eight. Also, I’m not blind, Emmy. Did you really think I wouldn’t notice how you bind your chest?”
“But -”
“And I’m not the only one who knew. Your mom did too. She once told me that doing back-to-school shopping felt like running a freaking marathon. She was proud of you, though. Hard not to be. You always knew who you were - an enby.”
“No, I’m not!” Emily responded loudly. “I know the history you keep hinting at. Ms. McGregor and Ms. Novak made damn sure I did. So believe me when I tell you that I have nothing to do with ‘lesbian expert’ Graham... um... Cracker, the LGB Alliance or any other monster wishing to spread hatred and fear. I am a proud genderfree - a person not bound to the rules of or the logic behind the traditional binary. My pronouns are variations on ‘it’ and... um...” She shook her head. “This is where I would tell you my new name, but I don’t have one yet. Whoops!”
“Um... Okay...” stammered Kacey. “Let me start from the top here: How do you know Jenna and Kelly?”
“Mom’s funeral. They’re the ones who helped me put all of my feelings together. Kept things nice and quiet... or so I thought, at any rate. Also, Ms. McGregor told me that I could get a job with her whenever I wanted one. What does she do, exactly?”
“Mini-golf and bowling alleys. About the rest...” She took Emily’s hand. “I can’t pretend that that word doesn’t bother me. But that’s on me. Honestly, I’m glad your generation took it back from the Mumsnet psychos. Screw ‘em. And his name is Graham Lineh... You know what? Never mind. He’s not worth the effort.”
90

“Yeah. He seemed terrible anyway.” She looked down. “So no new names, huh? That’s okay. I’ll keep thinking.”
“No!” Kacey blurted out. “I want to help! I just don’t know the rules anymore! Are we still going gender neutral, or...?”
“Non-trad – plants, animals, weather phenomenon... Stuff like that. I want something that speaks to me.”
“Oh... Okay.” Kacey cleared her throat. “Sunflower?” “Nah... I know like three of them and dated two.” “Sunshine?”
Emily smirked.
“Sunchoke? Sunfish? Poached sunfish in a white wine sauce?”
“Aunt Kacey...”
“What? I’m...” Kacey’s eyes grew wide. She found a name – an absolutely
perfect moniker for someone as special as the former Emily. She tried to stay calm, but a smile nonetheless slipped through. “I got one. Now, this isn’t exactly standard issue, but I think you’ll like it.”
“Go on...”
“Del. That’s what I used to call your mom and -”
“Perfect,” Emily – now Del – said, tears filling its eyes and its grip tightening
around the sides of the phone. “You can go full ‘faux-mom’ now if you want. I don’t -” Flash.
The phone, a relic of the past that had been supposedly laid to rest, emitted a momentary burst of light before fading away into nothingness.
“Aunt Kacey?” asked Del. “Did... Did you just see that?”
“I did...” she let slip. “Quick question: Did you happen to have ‘watch your mom’s cellphone wake the fuck up’ on your schedule for today?”
“No, I did not.”
“Want to help me figure out in the blue hell is going on, or will that throw you
off?”
“I think I’ll be fine. Mom would’ve wanted us to work together.” “Oh yes,” Kacey confirmed. “Yes indeed.”

Chapter Sixteen: Sentimental Lady
Dateline: The Home of Kacey Pflugh and Tara Wagner, New Sewickley Twp., PA -
Saturday, January 30th, 2049; 9:50 PM
Comments, By Caroline: A seminal moment in history – both the Collective and
otherwise.
Kacey sipped her spiced green tea from her recliner in the front room, watching as Tara’s biodiesel Volkswagen pulled into the garage above. Thirty seconds to exit the vehicle. Fifteen to close the garage door. Fifty steps to the front stoop, give or take ten or twenty for snow or ducks. Turn the knob, and...
“Special one?” His voice called out, barely rising above the squeak of dress shoes on vinyl flooring. “Wherever might you be?”
“Wherever you wish to find me,” she replied, smiling at their silly little tradition.
“Of course,” he continued, the steps drawing closer. “Could be anywhere. And
yet...”
“...Here I shall remain.” She turned to see Tara standing in the doorframe, his
jacket, vintage fedora and all related accessories still firmly in place. “I have always adored the way you wear winter.”
“As I’ve heard,” he chuckled, giving her a peck on the cheek before reverting to his original position. “I have an extra hat in my Collection, if you’d like one.”
“Tempting, but I found that sweaters and leggings are more my speed these days.” Kacey leaned back, holding her cup with both hands. “How did your speech at the rally go? Anyone get arrested this time?”
Tara put a kitchen chair into position – still facing the room but remaining a “respectable” distance away – and sat down gingerly. “Thankfully, no. However, I am beginning to realize that Western Pennsylvania statehood is little more than a pipedream.”
“KDKA said support is around 55% in town and 62% in the surrounding counties,” she responded. “Not too shabby compared to where we started.”
“...And in the negative digits in Philadelphia. The bigger population wins every time. But I wish not to talk about the corrupt machinations of Harrisburg, at least for the time being.” He leaned forward, smiling. “Has Emily been by today?”
“Yeah. Out on a food run. Back in a bit.” Kacey took another sip, dragging the moment out for as long as possible. “And its name is ‘Del’ now, by the way. Took it long enough. Not like I didn’t figure everything out a decade ago or anything...”
“A lovely tribute to a lovely person regardless,” Tara commented, quickly adding: “I, however, would have gone in a more... esoteric direction, shall we say. ‘Poached Salmon in a White Wine Sauce Holzinger,” perhaps.”
“Made the same Monty Python reference hours ago. It was not amused.” Kacey shifted in her chair, gaining just enough room to stretch her legs. “And who in the hell told you the big news?”
“Kelly, actually. She confided in me shortly after we opened. Couldn’t help herself. Jenna broke her silence a few hours later, but only after learning about our
92

favorite bartender’s loose lips. And finally, at the rally with Theodore, seconds before I took the stage.”
“Even Theo knew before me?” she spat out in surprise, setting what remained of her tea on the windowsill. “In what universe does that make sense? The ‘coming out’ phone chain goes mentors, then family, then the chill dude with the Acapulco Gold! That’s day one stuff!”
“I have found that some Theodore-centric questions lack a satisfactory answer. I wholly believe that this is one of those times.” He cupped his right hand under his chin, never once breaking eye contact. “Should I feign surprise when our nibling comes home?”
“No... I guarantee you the shock Del sees will be genuine.” Kacey reached into her left chair-side pocket, extracting a cherished object not seen in public for nearly two decades. She let the device dangle from her fingertips, all the while glaring at the words engraved on the case.
                         To Kacey –
             May the future be full of wonder.
                   All my love, Delilah.
                Pitt Graduation Day: 5/8/32.
“Remember this beauty?” She eked out, closing her eyes to avoid any excess displays of emotion.
“Ah, yes. Your iPhone. A monument to the overly stylized, consumer-grade nonsense force fed to...” Tara stopped mid-sentence. “Never mind. Old habits, I assure you. May I?”
“Yes but be careful. This is irreplaceable.” She reluctantly passed the device over, making sure not to touch any of the buttons on the side. “Hold down on the power and stare at the screen.”
He nodded, a slight look of confusion on his face. The room then fell silent, broken only by the sound of a one of a kind, customized cellphone crashing at his feet.
“See something interesting?” Kacey inquired, resisting the urge to scan for rogue cracks and scratches.
“I...” Tara let his hat fall to the floor. “You are, and I say this with the upmost sincerity, the only person alive capable of leaving me speechless.”
“Damn right I am,” she said, sporting the same knowing smirk she had the night he ultimately proposed.
“Now then...” Tara put his hands on his lap. “When, were and how did you first discover this? Also, why wasn’t your first reaction to drop everything and contact me?”
“And miss the moment to blow your mind? Come on, man!”
“Yes, indeed.” He took a deep breath – the kind long, contemplative moment Kacey had grown to love over the past decade – but kept his eyes to the ground. “Does Emil... Del know?”
“Del discovered this,” answered Kacey. “As you might have guessed, this revelation overtook our whole day.”
“Figured as much.” Tara scratched the back of his uncovered head. “I should want to study this, at least until I figure out why this phenomenon is occurring. I
93

should want to call the Collective for advice. But...” He plucked the phone from his feet, only to set it on his coat. “I have neither the desire nor the will to see any of those hypotheticals through. I would much rather pack this up, wait for our nibling to return home and watch the whatever is on television. That is what I truly desire.”
“But Tara, I...” Kacey stood from her chair slowly, stretching along the way. As she moved to fully face him, she noticed a pair of headlights stopping near the concrete staircase out front. “Fine. Why? Answer that, and I will never mention the phone or the flashing or anything else ever again. Honest to god. Just tell me why.”
“You.” He stood, flashing a contented grin. “Now then... What did you order for the evening? I am indeed up for any -”
“Oh, no,” she interrupted. “I need more than a monosyllabic response and a pleasant expression. I want a freaking answer, Tara.”
“Alright, then. History has shown that I am unable to maintain both a presence within the digital realm and a stable romantic relationship outside of it. I have to make a choice. And I pick you. Easy enough to understand, I reckon. Swing easy, special one.” With that, Tara Wagner, the architect of roundabout immortality and numerous other technological innovations, slipped off his penny loafers and happily made his way out of the room.
Kacey found herself standing in the corner of the kitchen, dumfounded. A million unwelcomed thoughts zipped through her head, all screaming at random intervals.
Merging is dead... because of you. The information revolution that changed the planet might remain dormant forever... because of you.
She began to breathe heavily, her hand quivering.
      Oh god. I... oh dear god... Maybe Jackie... what’s the damn
      time in Brisbane... I am such a...
“Aunt Kacey?” Del interjected from behind, the chill from the late January air still swirling around them. “You alright?”
“I... I think my brain melted,” she muttered. “I’m going to need a few minutes before I -”
“Hey!” yelled Tara from the living room. “Do we have a proud, genderfree visitor in our midst?”
“Hi Uncle Tara!” Del replied. “I have a salad for you – steak-style seitan and extra fries, just how you like it!”
“Wonderful! I wish to hear all about the real you, if you would so be inclined to join me.”
“One second!” It turned to Kacey. “Are you sure you’re fine? I heard you gasping when I walked in.”
“Yes, Del. Really. I’m good. I’ll be right in. I promise.”
It nodded, quickly making an exit of its own.
“I have no idea what the fuck is going on anymore,” Kacey intoned to no one
in particular. “Just when I thought I -”
“See, Uncle Tara?” she heard Del say in the distance. “None of this is normal.” “An excellent observation, if I do say so myself. Allow me to...”
94

Kacey felt a familiar tap on her shoulder.
“Wherever might you be, special one?”
“We need to talk about the flash... you... everything,” replied Kacey. “And eat.
Life-changing conversations are impossible on an empty stomach.”

Chapter Seventeen: Whaling
Dateline: The Home of Kacey Pflugh and Tara Wagner, New Sewickley Twp., PA -
Saturday, January 30th, 2049; 11:00 PM
Comments, By Caroline: A seminal moment not just for the Collective, but for
humanity as a whole.
In the corner of Kacey’s supposedly “cozy” living room, somewhere between the antique entertainment center and the scattered remnants of a deceased wood burning stove, sat a collection of artisan electronic treasures. Each and every one was a testament to how a little bit of ingenuity, loads of perseverance and access to a neighborhood scrapyard could turn even the most pitiful of lost causes into a megastar. Transistor radios with unnaturally long antennas and a newfound ability to access Accu-Weather. A piecemeal facsimile machine capable of receiving both FM broadcasts and the robust FX data band simultaneously. An oversized, reel-to- reel tape machine mounted to the wall and connected to four ceiling-based speakers. All special. All unique.
But even the grandest of turnarounds paled in comparison to her crowning achievement: the “Selectravision CED.” Intriguing. Confounding. A faux wood- paneled focal point of the dinner parties she always wanted to throw.
Kacey, in AV form.
Originally invented in the late 1960s by then-corporate titan RCA, the CED player, - capacitance electronic disc for long – employed a specially made stylus to play video from a custom vinyl record. The device instantly failed in the marketplace, unable to overcome dozens of production delays, a paltry library of titles and fierce, VCR-based competition. But Kacey loved the old device, giving up her Friday nights and Saturday mornings in hopes of one day achieving true analog perfection. And the dedication showed.
The so-called “Selectravision II” could not only play “traditional” CEDs, but multimedia postcards, German VinylVideo and all manner of audio as well. Modern connectors were added to the back, a tracking knob to the front and format selection dials to the side. Albums and films weren’t merely “picked” for playback, they were chosen. On this particular evening, the guest of honor had been selected not for the quality of the music, but for the title alone: The Optimist.
“Who’s this?” asked Del as the player began to click wildly. “Should I know them? Will you yell at me for even asking these questions?”
Kacey crouched in front of the machine, using a custom-made cartridge to flip the sides of the album over. “This is an old garage rock band from New Zealand called DD Smash. Our friend Jackie from Australia got me this for Christmas one year. And yes, you should know them – or singer Dave Dobbyn at the bare minimum. He’s a genius. Right, Tara?” She waited a beat. “Tara? Hello...”
“Yes?” he replied, waiting between bites of room-temperature French fries to respond. “Oh... The music. I rather enjoy them, to be honest. I found that taking a break from what is expected can be good for a person.”
96

“Damn double meanings. I swear...” Kacey stood, forcibly flipping the “play” switch using only her right foot. “Why won’t you drop the ‘chill’ act and just freaking talk to me? You don’t know how close I am to bursting into tears right now.”
“Oh, I do. But I fear debate number three will end on the same notes as parts one and two. And I simply cannot -”
“Yeah... we’re not doing this,” Del said with quick double clap. “Since a normal conversation is clearly not in the cards, I will be forcing myself to play moderator. You two are going to talk and work out your problems and not send each other into an emotional downward spiral. Got that?”
Tara nodded.
“Works for me,” answered Kacey as she moved into position behind the sofa. “Let’s get this over with.”
“Good. First question.” It turned suddenly, pointing its fork in a most accusatory fashion. “What the hell, Uncle Tara? Aren’t you the least bit curious as to what’s going on here?”
“I, for the emotional wellbeing of those around me, refuse to engage this phenomenon any further. End of discussion.” Tara paused, taking a small sip of red wine. “And for your edification, presenting an already discussed topic as new is bad form. The Carnegie Mellon debate team, a team you will make, provided you follow in a certain uncle’s academic footsteps, will not look kindly on such an infraction.”
“...And he’s not even being subtle anymore. Fantastic.” Del cleared its throat. “Aunt Kacey? Your response?”
“Being a well-meaning martyr doesn’t make your stance any less silly,” she shot back, forcing herself to ignore the colligate-themed sidebar. “As much as you don’t want to hear this right now, what happened between you and Kelly back then couldn’t have been helped. I mean, yinz two did kind of invent the whole ‘dating while merging’ thing. Maybe if you stopped your goddamn brooding a minute and actually talked to her, you would -”
“Until the day I pass for the final time,” he began, uncharacteristically breaking in mid-sentence, “I will have to live with the fact that my actions broke the heart of someone I once held dear. This is not conjecture or a simple matter of opinion. This is a fact. No amount of reconciliation with the offended party can make said fact any less true or undo any of the damage caused.”
“And the alternative?” posed Del. “I know I haven’t been around as long as you, but I found apologies work really well.”
“Prevention. And the easiest way to prevent a repeat performance is to not indulge in the activities that caused our initial downfall – merging included. So to answer your root question once again, no. I have no interest in following any of these leads, as I am intimately familiar with the end result. No one will experience what Kelly did that day. Not from me, at the very least.”
Kacey, at that very moment, wanted nothing more to scream in his face then start to sob. But she knew the importance of the debate at hand. Her response had to be perfect, down to the final syllable. She took a deep breath – two, three – and rested her elbows between the two seated participants. “In other words, you’re totally cool with indirectly killing large swaths of people because you’re not over a sixty-year-old breakup. Good to know.”
97

Nailed it.
Del, meanwhile, massaged its temples. “Um... Okay... Care to explain?”
      Bring us on home! Knockout blow!
“Between Jackie’s 97 collectives and Theo’s loose lips, there are tens of thousands of Swappers in the world today. And I bet that each one of them is waiting for you to get the process up and running again. But guess what, gang? That’s never going to happen! Yinz are all doomed thanks to Tara’s guilt! And ... And...”
Kacey... don’t go there. Don’t. Please. For the love of -
“...And me. I’m the one that brought you there. This is all my fault, not yours.”
Dammit!
“You told me at Thanksgiving this would happen. You looked me in the eye and swore that you would have to pick either swapping or a relationship. But I... I couldn’t let anything go, could I? I had to push and prod to I get what I wanted. And now thousands will die because I forced you to choose the wrong thing!”
“Oh dear.” Tara immediately rushed over, stopping just shy of her personal space. “Just so we are clear, would you like me to -”
“I’m having a fucking meltdown!” she snapped. “Fucking hold me!”
“As you wish,” he mumbled, locking her in a tight embrace. “I know what you’re trying to say, Special One. And I understand the ‘Kelly Novak’ levels of guilt you are feeling right now. But you need to accept the fact that my time – the Collective’s time - is done.”
“But -”
“There are currently five billion people alive and counting. Do you honestly believe that us three are the only ones to accidentally trigger a cell phone flash? Or that I am the only person lucky enough to have discovered the merging process? I hate that I have to say this, but you need to strengthen your trust in humanity. The next ‘me’ could be anywhere.”
“Yeah... I know,” she responded, moving her right hand to her side. A loud chorus of barking junkyard dogs filled the night, followed closely by the disgruntled hum of their electric boiler furnace. “I got the remote kickin’ yesterday, by the way. The radio waves were confusing the garage door opener, so I went the ultrasonic route. Works perfectly every time now.”
“Conversation whiplash aside...” Tara took a step backwards, an odd expression on his face. “Would you mind showing the class your work?”
“S-Sure,” Kacey said, pulling her latest creation out of her right sweater pocket. There in her still-trembling hand sat a stark black case that once belonged to a random video game cartridge. Two mismatched buttons were placed in the center, both accompanied by a homemade, masking tape label. “Ultrasonic thermostat remote. Green turns the heat on; white shuts the thing down.”
“I am such an oblivious dolt,” Tara mused. “My successor isn’t ‘in the wind.’ She’s you.”
98

This is a joke. This has to be a joke. Call him out on his bullshit!
“Fuck off!” panted Kacey. “Don’t fucking lie to me! I deserve better! Screw you!”
“I do not lie,” he responded calmly. “You routinely make sense of a world that confounds me. Who better than you to pick up the pieces?”
“No! I...” She stared at his face; his eyes.
Um... Is he being genuine? He seems genuine. Approach with caution.
“But cellphones don’t run on timing belts and ultrasonic soundwaves, Tara. I can’t do jack shit with the flash. The only...”
Throw out something crazy. Let’s see what happens.
Kacey took a deep breath.
      Hold... two... three... And showtime.
“Fine. I will take over as Grand Poohbah of the Immortals. But any time I get confused with computer crap, you’re there. Any time I need advice, you’re there. If hell freezes over and someone has to code, that’s you. But again, I’m in control.”
“...And I get to move into your guest room and help instead of going to college right away,” inserted Del. “Sounds fair to me. Uncle Tara?”
“You can guarantee that I will remain a glorified consultant, correct?”
She nodded. “Except for right now, of course. You’ll have to take lead until I know which end is up.”
“Fair enough,” He said with a smirk. “I think we have a compromise.”
“Wonderful.” Kacey gave him a peck on the cheek. “So... Where should we begin?”
“Well...” Tara leaned over, grabbing his food along the way. “Excuse me, Mx... Del, right? I don’t think we’ve been properly introduced. Care to rectify this unfolding situation?”
“Yes, but... flash first!” Del ripped its mother’s phone from the charging cable and held down the power button, positioning the device mere inches away from his face. The screen predictably flashed, followed by a fowl, heavy odor. “Um... Uncle Tara? Did these things always smell like melting plastic? Also, the back is suddenly super-hot, and I’m scared of burning myself.”
Kacey promptly took charge, gingerly moving the device to the dining room table. “New rule: Mom-phone is now strictly off-limits. Don’t want to burn the house down.”
“Agreed,” echoed Tara. “Now then... The floor is yours, our nibling.” “Okay... Um... My n-name is Del and...”
With that a new voice rang throughout her being. An optimistic, positive
voice.
Enjoy this.
99

“Damn right I will,” Kacey whispered as she walked over to her CED player. “Every single moment.”

Chapter Eighteen: Computer Games
Dateline: The Home of Kacey Pflugh and Tara Wagner, New Sewickley Twp., PA -
Sunday, January 31st, 2049; 2:00 PM
Diatribes, By DL: The Collective’s lax attitudes towards keeping fundamental
secrets is very much alive and well.
Sixteen supposedly defunct digital devices laid scattered across the living and dining rooms – six laptop computers, five cell phones, two desktops, two tablets and a digital camera. Out of those sixteen, nine had caught fire, five emitted the dreaded “mystery smell” from the night before and one unleashed what Del called “the wail of the damned.” But each and every one, at least for the briefest of moments, powered on. The trio knew they had stumbled into something extraordinary. They just didn’t know where to go next.
Enter Theodore.
“Thank Big Boy you’re here,” Kacey said, leaning against the hallway wall opposite the dining room table. “We’re stuck in a loop.”
“And I’m stuck sorting connectors!” Del slowly lurched from the guest room, arms full of mismatched cabling. “I tried to put the one that says ‘HDMI 3’ on the end into the back of that extra-large phone thing but they didn’t fit right so I tried to force them and then I got mad and...” It looked up and smiled. “And hello, Mr. Tahrenna! Save me from my misery!”
“Hey,” he replied with a smile. “How you doin’, Emil -”
“Del. I go by ‘Del’ now.”
Theodore scratched the back of his head. “You named yourself after the
world’s most boring old company? Why?”
“A tribute to its late mother,” corrected Tara as he walked in from the
kitchen. “The fact it now shares a name with a deceased technological concern is strictly accidental.”
“That makes more sense.” He took a small step back, colliding with the buffet behind him. “And what’s with all the old shit? Kacey trying to turn my old Macbook into a facsimile machine again?”
“Watch.” She extracted a phone from her sweater pocket and held down the power. “Did you see the fl-”
“Sweet holy fuck!” yelled Theodore. “How in the hell did yinz even discover this? And what’s that smell?”
“Dammit!” Kacey dropped the odorous brick to the carpet below. “To answer your questions, a fluke and a clear sign that we don’t know what we’re doing, respectively.”
“My apologies in advance for leading you on,” Tara began, “But this is where you would normally pose a follow-up.”
“Sorry man,” sighed Theodore. “In the past fifteen hours, I had to stop Al-Stu from sobbing, Dia.... I mean, ‘Captain Hennessy...’ from going full ‘Second Battle of Hastings’ on a pro-Commonwealth cop’s face, bum a car and bail both of their asses out of the Allegheny County Jail. At any rate, my brain is fried right now.”
101

“That’s what you get when you piss off an old mod like Diane,” she chuckled. “And what the hell happened, anyway? Tara told me last night everything went
fine.”
“Al got busted for terroristic whatever shortly after he and Jenna left. In
reality, his old ass car backfired in the presence of the wrong people. Everything’s cool now, though. So...” He clapped his hands. “Where’s your old shit?”
“...This is our ‘old shit, Theo. What did you expect to see? A Tandy 386 with a CD-ROM jammed into the side?”
“Yes, actually. ‘New’ isn’t working, so you go old. Yeah, 98% won’t turn over due to the age of the parts. But find that 2% that hasn’t shit the bed yet and you’re good to go.”
“Interesting point,” Tara said. “Maybe we should be aiming towards the ‘lower’ end of the spectrum. Commodore 64, perhaps? Newton?”
“Any of those, really. Hell, even cobbling together a working Sega and a tape drive would be triumph at this point. Might not be pretty, but hey... at least you could run Collapse.”
“Yes!” squealed Kacey, taking the moment to lighten the mood. “Loved that game! I once played for three hours straight, no breaks. No one could ever beat my
time.”
Theodore quickly navigated the tight space between the table and the
storage unit, taking a seat in the entranceway. “I’m talking about Collapse OS, the operating system made by some lunatic for when the world ended. You’re thinking of Columns, the puzzle game with the jewels. And I see your three hours and raise you four. And unlike some people, I didn’t lose. February in Toronto knocked me out before the game could. Ask Jackie. She’ll back me up.”
“But your world did end,” inserted Del, letting the cables tumble to its feet. “We wouldn’t be having this conversation otherwise.”
“The... uh...” He cocked his head to the side. “Last night... what did Carrie say the college crowd is calling this now? The Setback?”
“Correct,” Tara answered, nodding. “The Disruption is the event, while The Setback is the era on a whole. The individual who developed Collapse expected a motion picture style apocalypse, not a decade of forced rebuilding.”
“Right-o. Less ‘1964 chic’ and more ‘Mad Max.’ That’s why I call him Corporal Crazypants instead of hailing him as some unsung visionary.”
“I see...” Del rested its curled forefinger against the bottom of its nose. “And an ‘operation system’ is the thing that made all of this crap worth using, I’m guessing. Like an antenna or a typewriter ribbon.”
“Not to split hairs, but an OS was but one of many...” Tara stopped suddenly. “Close enough for the moment. Carry on.”
“So what happens after yinz get the Collapse thing on this ‘Sego’ or whatever the heck Mr. Tahrenna just said? All of this stuff would still be broken. How does that fix merging? I mean, that’s why we’re doing all of this. To bring merging back from the dead.”
“How...” Theodore turned towards Tara and Kacey, his nerves on full display. “We don’t...”
“Mr. Tahrenna, please. I’ve known about merging since that one Thanksgiving when Aunt Kacey claimed to be 91 or something. You all think you
102

hide stuff like this super well, but you don’t. If I ever had a secret society, I’d make sure all of our good stuff stayed a secret. Now then...” Del took a loud breath. “What will it take to get us into someone new? What did you use before?”
“An ever-changing lineup of hardware, augmented by a slate of custom software solutions,” commented Tara. “Smartphones, several applications running in absolute harmony, a heavily modified Bluetooth adapter for -”
“Signal hopping!” blurted Kacey suddenly. “Bluetooth delivered information by jumping from frequency to frequency. What if I built a radio or something that did the same thing? Like... Let’s say we hook up Theo. We run his memories into the Sega/Collapse deal, which then spits him out to, say...” She pointed towards the living room, her elbow emitting a soft “crunching” sound. “...The reel-to-reel on the wall. We then hook the deck to my box, and the box to... uh... some other thing that translates the signals. Plug in a pair of headphones and... merger. Does that make any sense? Sounds like I made this up as I went along.”
“Oh yes,” Theodore stated with an added smirked. “If anyone could build what you’re talking about, it’s you, Kace. And remember: Never apologize when in need of technobabble. That’s why we’re here.”
“And I can skip a week of school to help with construction!” added Del.
Out of the corner of her eye, she saw Tara smiling.
“A worthier successor could have not been found,” he said. “And to where do
we go next?”
“Collection diving for usable parts ...starting next week, obviously. We’re not
going to let this take over our lives again. That means no skipping school, no calling off sick from the bar and...” She made eye contact with Theodore. “I’m sorry, but what exactly do you do?”
“Little bit of everything, sprinkled with a lot of some things and a kiss of ‘nothing,” he replied. “The usual.”
“Yes, well... Keep doing that.” Kacey kicked the wall behind her, a physical exclamation point to a conversation she once thought impossible. “This is going to take years, but we can do this. Merging is officially back.”

Chapter Nineteen: Paperlate
Dateline: Wholey’s Market, Pittsburgh (Strip District), PA - Friday, February 5th,
2049; 12:40 PM
Comments, By Caroline: I dislike writing about moments I’ve lived through. I feel it adds a certain “unconscious bias” to an otherwise unimpeachable narrative. Harry Wagner, however, felt differently. He insisted that I craft this scene the way I remembered, my preconceived notions of bias be damned. This is for you, Harry.
Kacey took a moment to examine her surroundings, allowing the memories from “before” to wash over her. Before overfishing drove up prices worldwide. Before Setback-related logistics issues caused the supply chain to collapse. Before the rise of responsible, plant-based dining made the notion of a seafood-centric wholesale market laughable.
The chill from the industrial-strength refrigeration units. The packs of otherwise non-threatening rodents waiting in the shadows for kilos of unsold grouper. The visceral, pungent smell of death and decay that wafted through the air. Every last bit would be gone soon, leaving nothing but an empty building and a history book full of memories behind.
She would be smiling ear to ear, if not for...
“Ham!” She yelled, poking her order with her fork, a bright pink blob floating in the dead center. “...I saw ham. Those carnivorous monsters put ham in my haluski! The damn recipe is cabbage and noodles. I don’t see ‘dead pig carcass’ listed anywhere in that recipe, do you? Of course you don’t! That’s why this place is dying. Shoddy work like this!”
“No, this is place is dying because no one wants fish anymore,” answered Carrie, her voice seemingly echoing throughout the empty, balcony-style dining area. “If you’re having an issue, go complain. Not like you have to fight through a crowd these days.”
“Not worth the bullshit.” Kacey dropped her utensil onto the table and took a sip of her lemonade. “How long before they close up for good, you reckon?”
“Six months tops,” she commented. “That’s the reason why I wanted to meet up here in the first place. Take one long last look before they pull a ‘Kaufmann’s’ and turn this into an apartment building.”
“Yeah, well... better than sitting empty forever,” Kacey said, preemptively taking Carrie’s hand. “How’s your friend Carly doing these days? Is she out of the hospital yet?”
“Best case scenario? March. Influenza Kamden really did a number on her. But...”
She felt Carrie’s grip tighten.
“I get that what I’m about to say is minor by comparison, but I hate that they name these things now. Makes the pandemic sound trivial.”
“We humans are convinced we can fix everything. What we can’t instantly correct, we name.” Kacey closed her eyes, making sure to not break the physical
104

connection between the two of them “Hurricanes, cyclones, blizzards... Been that way since time began. Nothing wrong with a hasty retreat every now and then.”
“Oh, I know. But there’s a difference between ‘temporarily declaring defeat and regrouping’ and ‘not even trying to improve the world around us.’”
“Who says we stopped?” Kacey’s eyes immediately sprung open, revealing a concerned face and a puddle of cabbage-laced water on the tray. “Our cellphones shut down, so we filled the world with portable, radio-powered fax machines. Raising, farming and eating meat became a drag, so we switched to plants. Positive change does happen. Might not be as swift as we’d like, but still.”
Carrie nodded, a small groan of discontent slipping through.
“You want facts? Fine.” Kacey raised her free hand in the air, counting along with each new point. “One: The death toll from these things get smaller with every consecutive outbreak. Two: People are living longer post-flu than they have in decades. Three: There are researchers all over the planet studying Kamden and its siblings, trying to cobble together a cure. I wouldn’t be shocked if we had flu shots again within the next few years. And four...” She leaned in, nearly knocking over the haluski with her elbow. “Humanity has been through worse. and came out alright. The flu isn’t anything we can’t handle.”
“I wouldn’t go that far, but -”
“Don’t get me wrong,” she interjected, simultaneously putting her hands away, “I’m not saying you should place a bet. I simply want you to be optimistic about the days ahead. Remember: Things will work out if you give them enough time. They always do.”
“On that note...” Carrie pulled a small device out of her pocket, her pointer finger resting on the power button. “Theodore showed Bill and I yinz’s discovery last night. Brought us to tears.”
“...And there goes my reason for meeting up with you,” mumbled Kacey, smiling softly. “Why did I insist on showing him? I knew he couldn’t keep his damn mouth shut.”
“Loosest lips in town.” Carrie paused briefly, setting the smartphone to the side. “How’s the new merging machine coming?”
“W-What?” Kacey stammered. “I’m not -”
“According to him, you are ‘well on the way’ to building another machine.
Something about a Sega and reel-to-reel tape. I want to be excited, but... I don’t know. Sounds like he made the whole thing up on the fly.”
“That’s all on me. Theo merely repeated what I told him.” Kacey sighed, knocking some of the ‘juice’ from her abandoned meal onto the table. “Truth be told, I have no idea what the hell I’m doing, Carrie. I don’t have a ‘plan.’ I got parts and schematics. No, not even that. I have a vague notion of what those parts and schematics might be under the right conditions. Now the entire Collective is counting on me to...” She threw her hands in the air. “You know what? Forget that. I promised Tara and Del that I would be doing this for fun. So what if I fail miserably? I’ll only have the deaths of thousands on my conscience and -”
“You’re spiraling again. Take a breath, think things through and call Jackie as soon as you get home.”
105

“Right after you give me the bank loan needed for long-distance,” she quipped. “$8 a minute with a $21 ‘connection charge.’ Our last conversation cost
$925!”
“Write then,” countered Carrie. “Maybe a heart-to-heart with your ‘therapist’
will show you how much of a... Never mind.”
“Much of a...” Kacey repeated. “I’d rather hear something bad than be left
hanging.”
“Fine,” Carrie groaned. “...Hypocrite you’ve become.”
A mutated version of the statement bounced aimlessly throughout her mind,
overtaken by urges most unsavory. Louder and louder. Seconds became minutes.
      Hypocrite.  Kacey is a hypocrite. No one will ever
      respect or love you again because you are a giant,
      untrustworthy hypocrite.
“I... I have to go. Thanks for the pig carcass I can’t eat.” Kacey attempted to push her chair away, only to get stuck on the aging carpet. Another push. Three. Four. No movement. “Dammit!” she yelled, her face hidden in her hands.
“Perhaps ‘hypocrite’ is a bit strong,” Carrie reasoned calmly. “But the underlying sentiments fueling my statement remain. Humanity can do anything; you can’t do shit. Makes no sense.”
Kacey initially stayed quiet, trying to calm the various urges and sensations wreaking havoc. Her breathing slowed; her muscles loosened. Hands away from her face. Eye contact. Showtime. “There are five billion people in the world today. Let’s say that out of those five billion, 300 million are looking to solve a problem. Now let’s say that the first person fails in the worst way imaginable. That’s fine. There’s still 299,999,999 people digging for a solution. Have to like those odds, right?”
Carrie nodded, her facial expression staying steady.
“Now let’s look at the whole ‘saving merging’ thing. There’s me and... well, me. No one else is around to pick up the slack when I crash and burn. Even my fucking partner doesn’t want to get his hands dirty anymore.”
“Fair enough,” she responded as she slowly pushed her chair back. “And before I forget: Al-Stu’s car is stalling again. I didn’t want any of us to bother you, so I told him to replace his usual corn oil with some ethanol. You can thank me later.”
Deep within the back of her mind, the voice began to stir.
You know what Carrie’s doing here, right? Of course you do. She’s –
But Kacey paid no mind to the dissent. She simply shot up, picked up the now room temperature container of haluski and hurled it at a picture of the Pittsburgh skyline adorning the opposite wall. “Do you see the ridiculously stupid thing I did just now? That’s not even a millionth – a billionth – as boneheaded as telling the Antolines to put a form of gasoline in a diesel-powered vehicle!”
“And why is that?” asked Carrie. “I’m curious.”
“First of all...” She sat back down, using the brief pause to settle back into place. “Diane and Al-Stu’s original engine was a Ford V8 Flathead. Those things ran on fucking lead, Carrie. That’s why I swapped out the pack-in with something less poisonous.”
106

“...The diesel engine, right. So you took an old Volkswagen and -”
“Oh dear lord,” whispered Kacey under her breath. “No one, and I do mean no fucking one, would even contemplate putting a VW engine in a classic Ford. I used a 1983 International Harvester Indirect Injection 6.9-liter diesel V8 I pulled out of an old F-250 truck. The IDIs were one of the few early diesels that were both car- friendly and didn’t need computer assistance. Reinforcing the frame to support the extra 300 pounds was a pain, but otherwise? Worked like a dream.”
Carrie pushed her chair away from the table. “And where does the corn oil come in? I know ‘corn’ has something to do with this.”
“Diesel engines can run on biofuel – most commonly the corn oil fast food restaurants use in their fryers – with zero modifications. You just have to make sure the oil is super filtered. Don’t want an errant fried thing gumming up the works.”
“Of course. But this is Al-Stu we’re talking about. He ain’t filtering shit.”
“I know. That’s why I designed a system that did it for him. Full analog, too.” Kacey shook her head. “I appreciate what you’re trying to do here, but the Antoline’s is nothing like my mythical ‘merger machine.’ Anyone can fix up a car by themselves.”
“No!” Carrie yelled back. “They can’t! That’s the point! You are goddamn mechanical genius, Kace! That’s why Tara has so much faith in you! Why don’t you see that?”
“Simple: I -”
“Don’t answer that,” she grunted, elbows on the tabletop. “I have a proposition. Care to hear me out?”
“Whatever will end this conversation the quickest,” said Kacey.
“Good. A week before Kamden came to town, Carly gave me this... box she found at a yard sale. Big green paperweight with a spindle up front. Don’t know what the hell thing does outside of take up space in my trunk. I want you to unravel the mystery. If you can’t, I will happily agree with the asinine bullshit you’ve been spouting today. Deal?”
Kacey nodded.
“Great. Now help me clean up this mess.”
Kacey smirked, standing up once more. The voice began to whisper as she
moved closer to the ham and cabbage on the wall, but she didn’t hear the words.
107

Chapter Twenty: My Happiness
A Note from DL Christie: The following are two of the letters written by Kacey Wagner and Jackie DeNucci on Februrary 5th and 6th, 2049. Each piece is presented “as is,” with no corrections or edits.
Jackie –
I’m sorry to bug you at... What time is it in Brisbane, anyway? It’s a quarter past six here. That means it’s... Jesus... Five? Six in the morning? Are yinz the ones who are a half-hour removed from everyone else? I don’t remember. Australia is weird as fuck.
I’m writing this because I don’t want to pay the nutso long-distance charges that come with calling you. Yeah, I know yours is worse and I shouldn’t complain, but I’m going to anyway. At least your fees help fund rebuilding the phone system yinz tore down 20 years ago. Ours is because the US phone companies suck. I mean, I know yours suck too. But ours is worse in every way, shape and form.
Anywho... I don’t know what the hell to do anymore. I’m... Oh, that’s right. I’m writing this. I just can’t simply coast on my tone of voice here. Long story short: Me and my nibbling Del (formerly my niece E... never mind. I’m not going to deadname it here.) found that old cellphones light up while you hold down the power button. (Then they almost always catch fire, but we’ll just ignore that for now.) I immediately thought Tara would jump at the chance to try to bring merging back. But nope! He doesn’t give a shit. He said I should be the one doing it instead. Now, you know me. I’ll try anything once. But me being the idiot that I am tried it in front of Theo. And now your dumbass ex is telling everyone that I’m bringing merging back and I don’t know what to do.
I know all of that sounds (reads?) super dramatic. But that’s because it is. I don’t know what the hell I’m doing here. Yes, I know I can build some cool shit when I’m in the mood, as Carrie reminded me not but six hours ago. But I can’t do this! What if I fuck this whole thing up? I’m going to doom all of the swappers the world over to death. (No biggie.)
Even beyond indirectly killing thousands, how would I go about it? Tara thinks we can take an old Sega Genesis, load it up with some old ass operating system I’m convinced Theo made up on the fly and... I don’t know. Do stuff, I guess? It’s all stupid conjecture anyway. Nothing is ever going to come out of this.
So yeah... That’s where I’m at right now. Super cheerful place, I know. I’d like to write more, but Tara just walked in with Nepali momos. Have you ever had that? It’s like if Chinese dumplings, pierogis, ravioli and vegetable samosas had a baby. They’re awesome. Oh... And remind me to tell you about the green box Carrie gave me. I don’t know what it is, but goddamn if I’m not intrigued. I’m guessing either a pasta machine or a laundry mangle.
Write back soon! Kacey
108

Dear Kacey,
I believe in you, I’m rooting for you, and I love you. You can do this.
Jackie
PS: I have a Sega Mega Drive at the ready. Just tell me when to send it.

Chapter Twenty-One: Western Union
Dateline: The Home of Kacey Pflugh and Tara Wagner, New Sewickley Twp., PA -
Saturday, March 14th, 2049; 11:00 AM
Tangets, by Theodore: The first discussion of a legendary discovery. Proud as hell
to say that I helped.
“Quite a collection you have here,” Jenna commented, making her way past the piles of anonymous scrap lining the hallway walls. “Not surprised, to be honest. I always said you would become one with the junkyard sooner or later.”
Kacey shook her head, a small smile meaning poking through. “Yep. This is my life for the foreseeable future. Damn Theo and his ironclad logic...”
“I see...” Jenna smirked. “I hate to be the one to break this to you, but his ‘go old’ hippy contrarianism is totally full of shit. None of this crap is ever going to power on again.”
“Actually...” Kacey paused, pulling out a Polaroid from the back pocket of her jeans. An old-fashioned tube television - their television – sat in the foreground, displaying a functional video game start screen. In the right corner stood Tara, holding a copy of that day’s Beaver County Times.
“Sweet Blast Processing!” Jenna spit out. “A Sega Genesis!”
“Sure is. Thing lasted an hour before ‘the smell’ kicked in. That’s why I want to test every last device I can get my mitts on. Never know what we might find.”
“I get where you’re coming from, but...” Jenna crouched down, looking at the semi-twisted steel resting near her feet. “I think this used to be a dorm room fridge.”
“In my experience, most are. But every now and then...” Kacey spun around dramatically, pointing at the unsightly, olive-green object perched precariously on the buffet. A worn power cord rested over top of the unit, the frayed end tickling a thick, silver spindle on the right. A small of array of missing lights and switches adorned the front, most of which sat underneath an unreadable faceplate.
“...And what the hell is that? I...” Silence temporarily filled the air around them, dissipating a scant few seconds later. “Sorry, Kace. I’d normally say something witty and endearing, but.... Fuck me sideways. I got nothin’.”
“Stumped me, too... until I found this.” Kacey flipped the machine over, revealing an etched, stainless-steel plate bolted to the bottom.
Property of the Office of the Recorder of Deeds Beaver County Courthouse
810 3rd Street
Beaver, Penna.
Jenna leaned in. “That’s odd...”
“The staff and crew at the courthouse were several shades of clueless, so I went down to the Carnegie library in Beaver Falls to look at all the old government documents. Maybe I could catch a lead. After about an hour of digging, I began to notice a pattern with the equipment listed in the logs. Not the brands, either. I mean the physical -”
110

A semi-recognizable figure, a supposedly sentient mass of messy hair and monosyllabic moaning, suddenly lurched forth from the small, supplemental guestroom next to the kitchen. A “nightshirt” – in reality, piece of brand laden activewear designed both for and by a six-foot-four cis male – hung at its knees. “Time?” it croaked softly.
Well someone’s waking up late, aren’t they? And interrupting to boot! You just love that...
“Half hour past the grace period, Del,” responded Kacey. “You’re lucky I’m not your mother. She would’ve started banging pots within two minutes. I speak from experience. Now going back to -”
“Oh, I know all about mom’s ‘analog alarms.’ Trust me.” Del took a few steps forward, rubbing its eyes with the corner of its hands. “And is Ms. McGregor here, or am I hearing things again?”
“Both, more than likely.” Jenna took a half-step back, giving Del the space to shamble on through. “Ah, to be a Lo-Fi’er: No direction, no motivation, no student debt crushing their souls like an anvil...”
“Well, you Millennials can...” Del threw its hair into a rough ponytail. “...Something or other. Sorry. Brain’s not working right now. My latest project is out to kill me.”
“Oh?” Jenna tilted her head to the side. “And that is...”
Why are you even trying? They don’t care about what you have to say.
“Something you two can -”
“An open-band Ultrafax receiver module for my PFX,” it replied over Kacey’s half-formed objection. “Non-trad broadcasting is simply more interesting when it’s coming from Chicago or Atlanta. That’s an established fact. Unfortunately, all I can get right now is oWOW from Cleveland and Riverhounds soccer. What about you? Find anything fun?”
“The student union at Youngstown State University and a string of Godzilla movies from New Castle,” informed Jenna. “And what about you, Kacey? I’m sure you have a hand-crafted Ultrafax in at least one of these fridges...”
“On top the of SelectraVision II. We get Amazon from New York, Crave from Toronto and Illico from Montreal. But I... I...” Kacey scratched the back of her neck, the pride stemming from her game-based discovery mutating into a mass of nerves and self-doubt. “Never mind! You clearly don’t care about anything I have to say right now, and I’m convinced I’m being stupid anyway so -”
Don’t let the darkness take over. Yes, Jenna and Del keep butting in. Doesn’t mean anything right now. A find this big... Can’t keep that to yourself forever, can you? Take a breath and try again.
“Let me start from the top.” Kacey cleared her throat. “This machine on the buffet here is a Western Union Desk-Fax, designed to send telegraph-like correspondence from -”
111

“Telegraphs?” Del shouted, causing Kacey to jump. “Do I look like my sister? I’m sorry Aunt Kacey, but there’s nothing more boring in this world or any other than discussing freaking Morse code with a ‘graph head! Nothing!”
“Let me finish!” she snapped, gasping for air. “Please! I found out something really important but yinz keep talking and yelling and... I can’t do this!”
“...Shit...” Del reached out its hand. “Can I -”
“Shut up and leave me alone!” yelled Kacey. “Please! Just let me...” She took two steps towards the kitchen before stopping suddenly.
Okay... This is a bad one, even for you these days. But don’t let the bullshit welling up inside win. Please. Take a deep breath in, nice and slow. And... release. Again. In and out. Once more with feeling. You can do this, Kacey. You know you can.
“Yes, I can.” She returned to her original position, hands behind her back, “The Desk-Fax here delivered hand-written messages across the country in seconds. What you wrote is what the recipient saw. Perfect every single time with absolutely no Morse code involved. A pre-Disruption text message... from 1956. Do I have your attention now?”
Del and Jenna nodded simultaneously.
“Good. I bring this up today because...” Kacey closed her eyes. “I... I have a theory about the machine. About the Disruption. About everything. But I’m scared and you kept on interrupting and...”
Deep breath – two, three. Good. Now stay on topic, sweetie. Don’t be frightened. They love you and truly want to hear what you have to say. They’re just being a little spacy right now.
“We want to hear what you have to say,” reassured Del. “Please continue.”
One more breath for luck and...
“Civilization is stuck on a set technological path. As we move forward, there are certain benchmarks we instinctively have to hit. Once we do, we move on. Allow me to demonstrate.” Slowly but surely, Kacey began to rearrange the items on the buffet. A book. A non-functional cellphone. A PFX. On and on the redecoration went, until... “Finished.”
“Boy howdy,” remarked Jenna. “That sure is a gigantic line of crap you have there.”
“This will all make sense in a minute, guaranteed.” Kacey walked over to the left, grabbing the item riding the razor’s edge. “Humans, for example, are obsessed with the written language. We started with this thing: the letter. Benchmark number one.” She stared at the item within her grasp. “Okay, maybe not this exact thing.
This is our electric bill. But you get the idea, right? This is meant to be a letter.”
“Yeah...”
“After a while, we got so good at the whole ‘writing a letter’ thing that we decided to branch out. We started wrapping our letters in leather binding. We called them ‘books’ – benchmark two. But we soon found that replicating each of these bad boys by hand were a real pain. So we invented a machine that did the work for us – benchmark three. Once we got those up and running, we moved on to something else. Something better. Are you with me so far?”
112

“Yes, but...” Del paused, trading glances with Jenna. “Using that logic, every semi-functional gadget or tool we invent is a guaranteed instant success. What about the abject failures? I mean, it took three tries and an unthinkable global calamity before facsimile machines finally went mainstream. I didn’t even know that that Desk-thing existed until five minutes ago. Did we simply write off them off as ‘good enough’?”
Kacey smirked, shaking her head. “You’ve got this entire thing all wrong, Del. Once again, human beings don’t perfect ‘technology.’ We perfect benchmarks. There’s always room for failure within those benchmarks. Letters, as I just said, are a benchmark. But we didn’t start with the average letter, did we? No. We tried a wide variety of different methods – walls, scrolls, parchments, whatever – until we found one that worked the best. That resulting discovery, the one we couldn’t outdo no matter how hard we tried, and therefore became the benchmark.”
“So the machine is an overall failure,” reasoned Jenna. “Good enough for -”
“Let’s talk about the machine,” announced Kacey, relishing the opportunity to cut someone else off for once. “Amazing piece of equipment, if I do say so myself. Simply write a message on a special piece of paper, wrap it around the cylinder, put on a gum band and press the button. There were articles at the time that dubbed this ‘Western Union’s electronic message boy’ – no special training, no human error.”
Del nodded, with Jenna quickly following suit.
See? You got them paying attention! Good job! But keep going. Can’t rest on your laurels yet!
“Eventually, special units like this guy ended up in government offices and Cold War installations. There were even rumors of WU selling these devices to homeowners, but... I don’t know. Between the extra phone line needed and the telephone monopoly of the day, the thing would have never taken off. Moot point anyway. Xerox took over the fax game in the early 60s. Questions? Jenna?”
“Um... I think I’m speaking for Del here when I say that I have no idea what the hell you’re talking about anymore. We’re on a big path ‘o tech we can’t leave. Got that. And every now and then, in amongst our big pile of fuck ups, we hit on something huge. Okay, fine. But ol’ Desky here is neither. So what do call this, then? A step in the right direction?”
“Damn right we do!” Kacey walked to the far right end of the buffet, near the sofa. “Look all of the things sitting on this cabinet right now: Fax machines and cell phones formerly capable of sending text messages and even Liv the PFX. Without the Desk-Fax, none of these quite exist.”
Del took a seat on the floor, her hair once again dangling in front of its face. “...So even though the Desk-Fax and company weren’t the quite benchmarks we were looking for, we learned enough to move forward. Am I on the right track at least?”
“Oh yes. I -”
“I have question for the lovable nutcase near the sofa,” Jenna deadpanned. “And I’m sorry for the interruption.”
At least she apologized this time...
113

Kacey made a small gesture with her hands. “Yes?”
“Let’s pretend for a moment that I understand what the hell you’re talking about. So we hit a benchmark. We invent something that -”
“Discover,” corrected Kacey. “Benchmarks are discovered, while items that use, harness or pull us closer to the benchmark are invented.”
“Fine,” Jenna sighed. “Discovered. Anyway... let’s say we’re in Benchmark City. We had an issue, found the breakthrough that would fix the issue, made the thing do what we wanted and -”
Del tapped Jenna on the leg. “I think... I think you have things all mixed up here, Ms. McGregor. According to Aunt Kacey, we’re on a ride we can’t ever leave. Wouldn’t that mean that the benchmark comes before the issue? Like, we get with the benchmark, find all of the problems that live inside, then... I don’t know... try to fix them? Does this even make sense?”
“Yes!” confirmed Kacey, waves of excitement peppering her voice. “Go on... You’re so close...”
“Nah...Never mind. That would mean that society bends itself into a pretzel to fit the benchmark.” It paused, eyes opened wide. “We do, don’t we? Our discoveries don’t magically change to fit our needs; we change to fit the discoveries!”
“And there it is!” Kacey took a step to her right, almost tripping on an errant pile of scrap and cabling. “Think of how the old smartphones changed the way we drive, Jenna. No more paper maps. Terrestrial radio stations weren’t as important as they used to be. Pay phones were converted into Wi-Fi hotspots. We built cars with cellular technology already inside. We passed laws in order to make sure our newfound abilities don’t turn us into dangerous maniacs. If that doesn’t show the lengths humanity is willing to go in order to conform with a potential benchmark, then I don’t know what does.”
“And we ‘like’ being used by these benchmarks?” posed Jenna. “That’s the vibe I’m getting here. But there are thousands – millions – of pieces of media that says yinz two are full of shit. Magazines, radio, TV, Instagram... all evil entities out to rot the minds of young people. How can we love supposedly ‘love’ something we apparently hate so damn much?”
Kacey stayed calm, choosing instead to utter a name: “Bruno Sammartino.” “W-What?”
“Bruno Sammartino,” she repeated. “Tell Del about Bruno.”
“You don’t play fair, Kacey!” Jenna took a deep breath. “My first Act maternal
grandparents were Italian immigrants. Italians, even in early 1960s Pittsburgh, weren’t always treated so well. In the movies and on the radio, we were portrayed as violent, uneducated idiots with broad accents. My grandfather, Nano Joe, even had a running list of stereotypes our family should avoid. ‘Don’t box, because people believe that only dimwitted, mafia thugs box. Don’t own a gun. Don’t join the mafia, because... you see where I’m going here.”
Kacey nodded, biting the inside of her lip.
“But every Saturday at 6:00 PM sharp on WIIC channel 11, we could see world champion of professional wrestling, Mr. Bruno Sammartino himself, protect the Steel City from the forces of evil. Monsters. Villians. Drunk dudes from Milwaukee! Sometimes, he would act alone. Others, he’d ask for help from his friends – his cousin, a cowboy, a Native American, even the goddamn Batman. My
114

grandparents loved Bruno, going as far as never ever once changing the channel from WIIC. ‘Get up, Bruno,’ I remember Nano Joe yelling. ‘I know you can hear me! Stop that guy!’ And he did. Every damn time.”
“I hate to break this to you,” Del began, “but wrestling’s fake.”
“Predetermined,” she remarked. “But the validity of the contest didn’t matter to them. Bruno’s success was proof that people like them could be a respected, beloved hero to millions. He had an accent – a real, respectable accent that dare not be mocked – just like them. He survived hardships most couldn’t fathom, just like them. He did everything he could to be the very best... all without taking shortcuts or joining the mob, just like them.”
Kacey lean forward, grinning ear to ear. “So what came first, then: the heaps of criticism about television eating souls, or you grandparents’ elation at being properly represented in front of a live studio audience?”
“The latter. But...” Jenna groaned. “Fine. I see where you’re going. Happiness from finding the benchmark comes first, then all of the negativity.”
“Bingo!” yelled Kacey, adding a handclap for emphasis. “We approach each benchmark with optimism and wonder. The ultimately short-lived virus of overthinking comes later.”
Del stood slowly and stretched. “I gotta know, Aunt Kacey: how do you see this ending? I mean, there has to be an endgame, right? Colonizing other planets? Fullerdomes as far as the eye can see?”
“W-Well I...” Kacey stammered. “That’s a little weird and I think...”
Come on Kacey! Don’t chicken out at the finale! Tell them! Tell them now!
“Merging! Every conceivable path ends with merging!”
Jenna and Del stared at each other.
“Oh fuck...” muttered Del.
“I don’t see how you think that’s weird,” critiqued Jenna. “Makes perfect
sense. Well, as much as sense as your crazy ramble can make.”
“I... I guess...” Kacey took a few unprompted, inner voice-free deep breaths.
“At our current rate, merging should be hundreds, maybe thousands, of years into the future. And yet, our Collective, and Jackie’s Collectives and all the rest keep jumping ahead. For the life of me, I don’t know why. Doesn’t make any sense.”
“And why should that matter?” Jenna walked forward, joining Kacey near the sofa. “I think the question you should be asking is if we plan on taking the rest of the world with us this time. Line cutsies for a few hundred is one thing. But five billion? I think the technological path people might notice.”
“Yeah, but...” Del stopped cold. “You already made up your mind, didn’t you? You want to go wide!”
Kacey looked down, avoiding as much eye contact as possible.
“Of course! That’s why you were so upset at Uncle Tara’s refusal to explore the flash! I think the only question left is why you look so goddamn embarrassed right now. Because you shouldn’t be. A noble goal is a noble goal, difficulty be damned.”

Del’s right, you know. This is a noble goal. If anyone can pull this off, it’s you and your friends. So pick your head up, smile and say –
“...Up for some line jumping?”
“Yes!” exclaimed Del. “After I take my anxiety medication, meditate and put some clothes on!”
“Don’t have much going on today,” Jenna added. “I guess helping you bring out an analog Singularity would tide me over till Wheel of Fortune. Let me go to the car first.”
“I’ll take a walk with you,” said Kacey. “I have to feed the ducks anyway.” Jenna nodded, quickly bursting into song.
“Oh, the human mind’s connected to the Desk-Fax The Desk-Fax transmits to the Sega
The Sega writes to a CED
And I don’t know how the hell this works!”
...Are you thinking what –
“I am,” Kacey intoned. “Jenna’s on to something. These next few years are going to be a blast.”
